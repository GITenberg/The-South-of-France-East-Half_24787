of the Avenue de Thiers, Rue St. Ambroise, Rue St. Etienne, Rue St.
Aspais, and the Rue du Palais de Justice, extends from the railway
station to the northmost limit of the town. In the part of Melun on the

main street, in the part of the town on the right or north bank, is St.
Aspais, an elegant church of the 14th cent. surrounded by crocketed
gabled chapels. By the side of the main entrance rises a buttressed
square tower, terminating in a high peaked roof prolonged into a short
spire. In the interior are some delicately sculptured canopy work and 8
windows with valuable old glass. A&nbsp;few yards off the main street is
the Hotel de Ville with a round attached turret in each corner; and in
the centre of the court a marble statue to Jacques Amyot, born in 1514,
“Un des Grandes Reformateurs de la langue française au 16<sup>me</sup>

ancient columns. Near it is the Place St. Jean, with a handsome
fountain. North-west from St. Aspais are the Prefecture and the belfry
St. Barthélemy, restored in 1858. The Palais de Justice, the theatre,
the Gendarmerie, and another of the prisons, are all together at the

<b>Fontainebleau</b> deserves a visit, not only to see the Chateau, but
to enjoy the delightful air and walks in the gardens and woods, which
cover an area of 18,740 acres, intersected by 12,000&nbsp;m. of roads
and footpaths. The palace consists of square towers linked together by
congeries of low brick buildings, enclosing spacious courts, each
bearing some suggestive name. The roofing is said to occupy 14 acres.
The palace is open from 11 to 4. The men who show it attend in one of
the rooms on the left side of the “Cour des Adieux,” or “du Cheval
Blanc,” which court forms the <i>main entrance</i>. A&nbsp;small fee is
expected; but as the Palace belongs to the State, it is not
obligatory.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
To see the “appartements reservés” an especial order is requisite,
procured by letter addressed to “M. Le Commandant des Chateaux.” The
“appartements reservés” comprehend sometimes a greater, and sometimes a
smaller number of rooms, according to the requirements of the household,
but never any of the splendid halls. The order observed in showing the
Palace is constantly changed, yet the itinerary we give will be found in
the main correct. It is sometimes reversed.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The Chateau of Fontainebleau, as it now stands, was founded by
Francis&nbsp;I., who commenced by demolishing the whole of the former
edifice, excepting the pavilion of St. Louis, which still exists. Henri
IV., who spent £100,000 upon it, doubled the area of the buildings and
gardens, and added, among other portions, the gallery of Diana and the
gallery des Cerfs. Napoleon&nbsp;I. expended £250,000 upon it, and Louis
XVIII. and Louis Philippe contributed also large sums.</p>

on the 20th of April 1814, of the ever-faithful soldiers of his Old
Guard, from whom he tore himself away amidst sobs and tears, and threw

as well housed as his majesty.” Louis XI. was married in this chapel.
The divorce between Napoleon and Josephine was pronounced in it; and
here, in 1810, Napoleon&nbsp;III. was baptized. The paintings are by
Fréminet, made during the reigns of Henri IV. and Marie de Médicis and
Louis XIII. The high altar was finished in the reign of Louis XIII. by
Bordogni. The reredos is by Jean Dubois. The statues on each side of the

sword and coat of mail worn by Monaldeschi, when he was assassinated on
the 15th of October 1657 by order of Christina of Sweden, second
daughter of Gustavus Adolphus. The atrocious deed took place in the room
immediately below, in the Galerie des Cerfs. The unfortunate man, in
parrying the first thrust, had 3 of his fingers cut off. He then fell on
his knees before his confessor Father Le Bel, sent him by Christina,
and, while praying God for pardon of his sins, one of the murderers
thrust his sword into his face; while the other first cut off the crown
of his skull, and then pierced his throat, which made him fall to the
ground, where he lay breathing for quarter of an hour. Throughout all
this terrible scene the kind priest kept bawling aloud with all his
might consolation to the dying man. That same evening he was buried,
near the holy water basin, in the church of Avon, 1&nbsp;m. E. from the
chateau, at the extremity of the park. Monaldeschi was Queen Christina’s
chamberlain, and is supposed to have betrayed some of her secrets. The
Marquis begged most piteously Father Le Bel to implore the Queen to
spare his life; but when the confessor went to her and beseeched her, in
the name of Our Blessed Lord, to have mercy on the unhappy man, she
replied with petulance, “that she could not, and that many had been
condemned to the wheel who did not deserve it so much as this

The <b>Cathedral of St. Etienne</b> was commenced in 972, but nearly
rebuilt two centuries afterwards. The façade, though not without beauty,
is heavy and massive. The south tower, 240 feet high, has a belfry
attached to it. In the interior, coupled columns, alternating with
massive piers, run down each side of the nave, supporting pointed
arches, over which runs a triforium of round arches on clustered
colonnettes. Against the 5th pier left is a reredos, with sculptured
canopies. In the chapel immediately behind the high altar is a beautiful
relief in marble, representing the death of St. Savinien, first bishop
of Sens, who suffered martyrdom in 240. In the adjoining chapel is the
mausoleum of the Dauphin, brother of Louis XVI., by G.&nbsp;Coustou, and
statues of Archbishop Duperron and his nephew. In the next or 3d chapel,
<a name = "sens_becket" id = "sens_becket">Becket</a> used to officiate.
The picture on the wall by Bouchet, 1846, represents his assassination.
He stayed, 1166, in the abbey of St. Columba, 1&nbsp;m. from the
cathedral. It is now occupied by the Sœurs de l’Enfance de Jesus. The
transepts are lighted by superb glass; but the best window is the second
to the right on entering from the façade, painted in 1530 by Jean
Cousin. In a glass case in the treasury are the mitre, albe, chasuble,
stole, and maniple worn by Thomas à Becket; discovered in 1523 in an old
house adjoining the cathedral; yet there does not exist sufficient
evidence to prove that they are genuine. In the same case is an ivory
crucifix by Girardon. In the case behind are enamels from Limoges, 15th
century, and two small paintings on marble by A. del Sarto. Next them is
valuable old tapestry. Near two shrines is a deed signed by St. Vincent
de Paul. In one of the shrines is a bone of the arm of Simeon. Adjoining
the cathedral is the hall, called the Officialité, restored by Violet le
Duc. The convent of St. Colombes is about 1&nbsp;m. from the church, and
to the left of the high road. The only portion of the present buildings
that existed in Becket’s time is the piece parallel to the Abbey Church.
When in France, he lived chiefly in the Cistercian Abbey of Pontigny,
7&nbsp;m. S. from St. Florentin, <a href = "#st_florentin">page 16</a>,
and 13&nbsp;m. N.E. from Auxerre, <a href = "#auxerre">page 14</a>.
<b>Becket</b> was assassinated at the foot of the altar of St. Benedict
in Canterbury cathedral in 1170, and canonised two years afterwards.
Down to the Reformation pilgrimages were made to his shrine by devotees
from every corner of Christendom. Every 50th year a jubilee was
celebrated in his honour.</p>

in France, was commenced in 1208, but as it was not finished till the
end of the 16th century, represents the different styles of these
intermediate epochs. The fine western façade belongs to the 16th
century, while the portal of the N. transept belongs to the 13th. Three
hundred and seventy-eight steps lead to the top of the tower rising
above the western façade. The building is 352 feet long, and the
transept 154 feet. Two spacious aisles run up each side of the nave,
separated by clustered columns supporting pointed arches, the front row
being surmounted by a narrow mullioned triforium and a lofty clerestory,
both lighted by beautifully-painted glass windows. The height of the
roof of the nave is 92 feet, and of the cupola 192. The glass of the
windows of the choir, of the roses in the transepts, and over the
western entrance behind the organ, is of the 13th cent. The marble
statues of Jesus and Mary in the first chapel, N. side of choir, are of
the 16th cent., and the altar piece, with reliefs in wood, of the 17th
cent.

Before the high altar in this church <a name = "troyes_henry_v" id =

Princess Catherine, daughter of Charles&nbsp;VI. of France, on the 20th
May 1420. Next day the famous treaty was signed, which secured the crown
of France to Henry by the exclusion of the dauphin Charles, whenever the
poor mad Charles&nbsp;VI. should cease to live. Behind the high altar in
the Lady chapel is a Madonna by Simard, and the window containing the
oldest glass in the church. A&nbsp;stair to the right of the high altar
leads to the treasury, of no great interest. It contains croziers of the
13th century, reliquaries of St. Loup and St. Bernard, with enamels of
the 12th century, a&nbsp;tooth of St. Peter in a small gold box, etc. In
the reliquary of St. Bernard is a bit of the skull of an Irish primate,
St. Malachie, who lived between the 11th and 12th centuries. A&nbsp;few
yards to the N. of the cathedral is the building containing the
<i>Library</i>, open from 10 to 3, with 125,000 volumes and 3600 MSS.,
in a large hall, with windows composed of curiously-painted panelled
panes. Among the illuminated books are a Bible of St. Bernard and St.
Paul’s Epistles, 12th century. In the same building are the
<b>Museum</b>, or picture gallery, with paintings by Watteau, Coypel,
Mignard, etc.; and the <a name = "simard" id = "simard"><i>Salle
Simard</i></a>, containing a valuable collection of the <b>Models made
by Simard</b> for his statues and works in relief. Also some statuary by
Girardon, and other French sculptors. The museum is open to the public
on Sundays and feast-days from 1 to 4. On other occasions a small fee is
expected. A&nbsp;short distance eastward from the cathedral is the
Hospice, and a little beyond St. Nizier, with painted panel panes in the
window of the sacristy. The glass in the windows of the church is of the
16th century. Westward, in Rue Urbain IV., is a gem of Gothic
architecture, the church of <b>St. Urbain</b>, built by that Pope
towards the end of the 13th century. The high altar occupies the place
where his father used to sit in the exercise of his calling, which was
that of a cobbler. A&nbsp;short way N. is <b>St. Remi</b>, 14th century,
with a bronze crucifix over the altar by Girardon. Directly W. from St.

1670. Beyond is <b>St. Jean</b>, 14th century. The high altar was
sculptured by Girardon, while the painting of the Baptism of our Lord,
forming the reredos of the altar, is by Mignard. Behind, in the chapel
“O Sacrum Convivium,” are some good relief sculptures. From St. Jean,
pass up northwards by the Rue de Montabert. At the N. corner of the
first division is the Post Office; and at the end of the next division
is <b>La Madeleine</b>, commenced in the 12th century, and remarkable
for its magnificent jubé, or rood-loft, constructed by Jean de Gualde in
1508. The beautiful windows behind the altar belong to the same period.
The nearly flat roof might have been called an achievement in Gothic
architecture, if the vaulting did not show signs of weakness. West from
St. Jean is <b>St. Nicolas</b>, 16th century, near the Hôtel Mulet. To
the right of the entrance a broad staircase leads up to a Calvary
containing a colossal statue of Christ. In the chapel below is a statue
of our Saviour by Gentil, representing him as rising from the dead.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
Near St. Nicolas is St. Pantaleon, 16th century. To the right on
entering is a Calvary by Gentil. On the panels of the pulpit are
beautiful reliefs in bronze by Simard. Behind the pulpit is the chapel
of St. Crispin, the patron of shoemakers, containing curious groups. The
glass of the windows is rich, while the numerous statues on consoles
give the church the appearance of a statue gallery.</p>

South from the church St. Pantaleon by the Rue de Croncels, and its

the Church of the Madeleine; restored by Violet le Duc. The narthex
belongs to the 12th cent., the nave and aisles to the 11th, and the
choir and transept to the 12th and 13th. The length of the building is
404, and the height of the roof 70 feet. The exterior is unadorned, and
supported by plain receding flying buttresses. The doors and tympanum of
the western entrance are enclosed by a wide expanding circular arch with
four sculptured ribs. Above rises a large window with boldly sculptured
mullions. Within the doorway is a spacious narthex, of which the
triforium is filled with antiquities connected with the monastery which
adjoined the church. To appreciate the noble proportions, simplicity,
and harmony of this vast edifice it is necessary to have the door
between this narthex and the nave opened. The nave and aisles are
lighted by forty small round-headed windows, and their roofs rest on
forty semicircular arches springing from massive piers, with attached
columns ornamented with the peculiar capitals of their period.
A&nbsp;triforium runs round the transept and choir. Eleven circular
columns, of one stone each, support the arches which enclose the
sanctuary. From the S. side of the choir a door opens into what was
formerly the “salle capitulaire,” built in the 12th cent. The cloister
is a modern addition by Violet le Duc, who also constructed the altar in
the beautiful crypt below the choir. Near the abbey church is St.

The parish church, 12th to 15th cents., is small, but interesting. The

The sanctuary is surrounded by a screen composed of slender colonnettes
standing diagonally, and is shut off from the nave by a beautiful

Pontigny a coach runs every other day to Auxerre, 13&nbsp;m. S.W.,
stopping at a café near the station. The greater part of the church of
Pontigny was built in 1150. It is a plain vast edifice with narthex and
round turret at main entrance. The interior, which is grand and
imposing, is 355 ft. from W. to E., 72&nbsp;ft.

massive piers. There are 11 chapels in the choir, but none in the nave.
A&nbsp;row of small round-headed windows extends round the church below
the arches, and another, exactly similar, above them. In a shrine, 18th
cent., behind the high altar are the bones of St. Edmund, Archbishop of
Canterbury, who died in 1243 at a village in the neighbourhood. The
original shrine, a&nbsp;plain wooden coffin, is upstairs in the
cloister. The view of the interior of the building is spoilt by an ugly
screen, rendered necessary to shut off the sanctuary from the rest of
the church to make it more comfortable for the villagers, whose parish
church it has now become. The abbey buildings, of which parts still
remain in good condition, were inhabited by Becket. In the treasury is
the black strip of a stole he used to wear, sewed on to another stole.
Also relics of St. Edmund, and curious deeds connected with him and
others, who had retired to this, then an austere Cistercian monastery.
The walls of the cloister are hung with engravings representing scenes
in the life of St. Edmund.</p>

<p>Becket arrived at this abbey on the 29th of November 1164, and
remained till Easter 1166. From Pontigny he went to Vezelay, and from
Vezelay to Sens.</p>

consisting of a hexagonal pedestal, having on each side a statue of one
of the prophets, by Claux Sluter in the 14th cent., the sculptor of the
ducal monuments in the Palais des Etats. The statue of Moses is the
least successful, and that of Zachariah the most expressive. The house
contains on an average 500 patients. Dijon is not a town for sightseers,
but an admirable town for resting during a long journey. The Cloche and
Jura are comfortable houses, and although La Galêre is less so, its
charges are more moderate, while its fare is better. There are a number
of pleasant walks. Just beyond the arch is the Promenade du Chateau
d’eau, and at the foot of the railway station the Botanic Gardens.
Towards the extremity of the gardens is a black poplar 490 years old.
The southern continuation of the Place de St. Etienne leads by the Rue
Chabot Charny, the Place St. Pierre, and the Cours du Pari (1465 yards
long), to the public park. From Dijon the rail runs southwards parallel
to the slopes of the famous wine producing hills of the Côte d’Or,

Bordeaux is that of the claret merchants. Around it are the first-class
vineyards of Beaune Pommard, Volnay, and Romanée. Of these the Volnay
vineyards, extending over 532 acres, produce the most valuable wine,

Notre Dame, founded in the 12th cent., contains semicircular and
equilateral-triangled arches and cusped and Corinthian capitals.</p>

<p>In the Place Monge, off the street de l’Ile, is a bronze statue to
Gaspard Monge, the inventor of descriptive geometry, born at Beaune in
1746. To him France is indebted for the establishment of the Polytechnic
School. Contiguous to the Chevreuil Inn is the hospital, built in the

the ancient Bibracte, claims with Trèves the honour of having been built
before the Roman invasion. Cæsar spent a winter in this city with two
Roman legions; and at a later period, when the Emperor Augustus went to
Gaul, he made Bibracte his headquarters, and erected so many magnificent
public buildings that the name of the town was changed to Augustodonum,
modernised into Autun. Napoleon&nbsp;III., in his “History of Cæsar,”
considers, however, that the site of Bibracte was on the summit of Mount
Beauvray, 14 miles westwards, where coins of Gaul, mosaic pavements,
fragments of pottery, and an enormous number of amphoræ, have been
discovered. The walls of Autun were 10,000 feet in circumference and
8&nbsp;feet thick, and were garnished with 40 towers, and pierced with
four large gates, of which two&mdash;the Porte d’Arroux, 55 feet high,
and the Porte St. André, lately restored&mdash;still remain. The Porte
d’Arroux and the temple of Janus (a&nbsp;plain square tower) are behind
the railway station. But the Porte St. André, adjoining an ancient
church, is on the town side of the line at the Faubourg St. Jean. The
<b>Cathedral</b>, which commands the entire city, was completed in 1178.
The architecture of the modern portions is Gothic, but the more ancient
is Romanesque. The two towers have been restored and adorned with Gothic
spires. The interior contains several windows of painted glass. The
entrance is by a handsome open portico with sculptured arches and
columns. From the Porte St.

From this church, the narrow street, the Rue de la Visitation, leads up
to the nunnery of the Visitation, an order instituted in 1620, and
established in Paray on the 4th September 1626 by 8 nuns from the
monastery of Bellecour at Lyons. In 1633 they commenced to build their
chapel, which was repaired in 1823, and restored and beautified in 1854.
To this chapel the order attach great importance, as it was in this
building that Marguerite-Marie Alacoque had most of her interviews with
J.&nbsp;C. In the interior the walls and roof are
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
<!-- png 057 -->
painted light brown, with frescoes and marguerites or daisies, but so
hung with banners and votive offerings, chiefly hearts, that little of
them is seen. The first picture, right hand, represents J.&nbsp;C. and 3
angels before Marguerite. The 2d, J.&nbsp;C., with flowing yellow hair
and dressed in white, stoops to touch with his heart (which is very red
and outside his garment) the head of the kneeling Marguerite, who holds
her hands up near to her neck. The 3d is a full-length portrait of her.
To the left of entrance the pictures are&mdash;1st, a&nbsp;Vision; 2d,
Mary, sitting on a cloud, has put the child Jesus into the arms of
Marguerite; 3d, life-size statues of J.&nbsp;C. and Marguerite. The
picture over the high altar represents the interview in this place, when
J.&nbsp;C. is said to have declared to Margaret: “I&nbsp;have chosen and
sanctified this chapel, that my eyes and my heart may remain here for
ever.” On the 2d July 1688 Mary, in great pomp and majesty, accompanied
by numerous angels, appeared to Marguerite, and told her that the orders
of the “Visitation” and of “Jesus” (the Jesuits) were to have the
special charge of the worship of the sacred heart. For this worship
there is a regular litany, containing 31 invocations to the heart of
J.&nbsp;C. In many of the Romanist churches is a picture representing
one of the above incidents.</p>

The bones of Marguerite, covered with flesh-like wax, and attired in the
habit of the order, recline on a silver embroidered cloth in a
coffin-like shrine of richly-gilt, tiny glazed arches set with
rock-crystal. The face and hands are uncovered. The body is 5 ft. long.
On her feast day the shrine is placed beside the Communion rail; at
other times it is kept within the very beautiful altar-table, made of
one piece of pure white marble. Marguerite-Marie Alacoque was born 22d
July 1647, in the village of Versovres, near Autun, entered the convent
of the Visitation in Paray on the 25th May 1671, and took the vows on
the 6th November 1672. On the day when J.&nbsp;C. told her she had been
chosen by him to propagate the worship of his heart, she was seized with
a pain in her own heart, which continued throughout her life. She met at
first with great opposition in her endeavours to institute the worship
of the heart, and her sister nuns treated her as a visionary till 1675,
when the R.&nbsp;P. de la Colombière, superior of the Jesuit
establishment at Paray, became her convert. In her last illness she
said: “I&nbsp;shall die in peace, because the heart of my Saviour
commences to be known.” She died in October 1690, and was canonised by
Pio IX. on the 14th October 1864. Since the institution of N.&nbsp;D. de
Lourdes and de la Salette the number of pilgrims has decreased. In Paray
there are 3 nunneries and a vast building belonging to the Jesuits.</p>

<p>Lyons is a strongly-fortified city, intersected by two of the largest
rivers in France, the Rhône and the Saône, which form as they approach
each other the isthmus, 545 ft. above the sea, on which the finest part
of the city is built. This portion is traversed by three great streets,
the Rue de la République, the R. de l’Hôtel de Ville, and the
R.&nbsp;Centrale, and contains the three most important and beautiful
squares, the Places Perrache, Bellecour, and Des Terreaux. The Place
Perrache, in front of the station, was planted with trees in 1851. In
the centre was a bronze statue of Napoleon&nbsp;I. by Nieuwerkerke,
which was taken down in 1870 and afterwards destroyed by order of the
municipality. In its place is a fountain. The Place Bellecour
(Bella-Curia), 339 yards long and 328 yards wide, is also planted with
trees. In the centre is an equestrian statue of Louis XIV. by Lemot,
which occupies the place of a former one by Desjardins, destroyed in
1793. Trams to all the important parts of the city run through these two
squares. The Place des Terreaux, flooded with human blood in 1794,
during the reign of terror, has on the south side the Palais des Arts,
on the east the Hôtel de Ville, and on the west a block of buildings
pierced by an arcade decorated by P.&nbsp;Delorme and Maupin (see
page&nbsp;37).</p>

<p>The Rhône is crossed by 9 bridges, and the Saône by 13. The extent of
substantial and spacious quays on both sides of these rivers measures 24
miles. For sailing on the Rhône the best steamers are the Bateaux
Parisiens, starting from the quay in front of the Place Tholozan behind
the Hôtel de Ville, and plying between Lyons and Avignon. For short
sails on the Saône the Bateaux Mouches are very convenient,

site of the forum erected by Trajan, the Forum Vetus or Foro Vetere;

visited as early as possible, even should there be no time for anything
else, on account of the excellent bird’s-eye view of the city obtained
from it and its terraces. At the west end of the bridge of
<b>Tilsitt</b> across the Saône, at the upper side of
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>

the “Place,” is the <a name = "lyons_rope_railway" id =
"lyons_rope_railway">rope railway</a>, which ascends through tunnels the
hill of Fourvière, the length of the Place des Minimes about ¾ of the
way up the hill. Fare, 5 sous. From the station walk up, right hand, by
the broad road, l’Antiquaille. At the highest part of this road is a
large ugly edifice, the Hôpital de l’Antiquaille, especially devoted to
the treatment of insanity and of cutaneous diseases. It has
accommodation for 600 patients, and occupies the site of the Roman
palace in which Claudius and Caligula were born. From in front of this
hospital commences a narrow steep road called the Montée de Fourvière,
lined nearly all the way with little shops stocked with wares for the
pilgrims and devotees, such as images, crucifixes, amulets, chaplets,
medals, photographs, and books. At the top are restaurants and
hotels.</p>

<p>On the summit, 1206 feet above the sea and 410 feet above the Saône,
is the chapel of the “miraculous” image of Notre-Dame-de-Fourvière, from
which rises a domed tower crowned with a gilt image of Mary 6½ ft. high.
This tower is ascended by 200 steps, fee 25 c., and commands a superb
view of the city and environs. Lyons and its two great rivers are
immediately below, while in the distance, if the weather be clear, Mont
Blanc is distinctly seen. As for the sacred image itself, in the church
below, it is about the size of a big doll, and the child rather less.
The number of worshippers having become so great, the adjoining church,
which is more elegant and much more commodious, was constructed in 1884.
It stands on the very brow of the hill, and is the most prominent object
in Lyons. In shape it is rectangular, with at the eastern termination an
octagonal tower 115 ft. high, which forms the chancel. At each of the
four corners is a similar tower, and in each of the two sides are three
large windows separated by buttresses like square towers. Round the top
of the building as well as of the towers extends a balustrade of stiff
sculpture resembling acanthus leaves. The large buildings in the
neighbourhood are convents.

stones of which they are composed. Beyond is the bridge of St.

<p>The Terminus of the rope railway from the Pont Tilsit is at No. 42

distance of the church of <a name = "lyons_st_irenee" id =
"lyons_st_irenee"><b>St. Irénée</b></a>, on the summit of a hill in the
suburb of St. Just. On the terrace at the east end of St. Irénée are a
Via Crucis and Calvary, commanding a superb view of the plain watered by
the Rhône and the Saône. By the N. side of the church is the entrance
into the crypt. The first flight consists of 25 steps; and the second,
which terminates in the crypt, of eight. On the first arch across the
first flight an inscription states: “Cette crypte fut construite par St.
Patient evéque de Lyon au V siècle sur l’emplacement du lieu ou St.
Pothin et St. Irénée, envoyés a Lyon par Polycarpe disciple de l’apôtre
St. Jean, reunissaient les premiers chretiens. De nombreux martyrs y
furent ensevelis.” On the second arch another inscription states that in
1562 the Calvinists having injured the crypt and thrown the bones of
animals among those of the saints, Grolier, Prior of St. Irénée,
restored the building, separated the bones, and placed those of the
saints in that small vault to the right, at the foot of the first
flight. In the centre of the crypt is a now covered up well, the
original resting-place of the martyrs, down which their bodies were
thrown till it overflowed with blood, in the reign of Septimius Severus,
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 202. To visit the calvary and
crypt apply to the concierge, 50 c. The church of St. Irénée has nothing
particular. To the west, in the parish of Ste. Foy, are the remains of
the Roman aqueduct which brought water to the city from Mont Pilat. It
was 52 miles long, and capable of supplying 11,000,000 gallons per day.
At present the water-supply of Lyons is obtained from the Rhône.</p>

<p>Opposite the commencement of the rope railway, and close to the

"lyons_cathedral"><b>Cathedral</b></a> of Saint Jean, founded in the 8th
cent., repaired by Archbishop Leydrade, friend of Charlemagne, and
reconstructed almost entirely three centuries later. The chancel dates
from the end of the 12th cent., the lower part of the façade from the
13th, and the upper from the 14th cent. The exterior is chastely
decorated, but the four towers are too low. The interior, 259 ft. from
W. to E. and 108 ft. high, contains some brilliant 13th, 14th, and 15th
cent. glass. The wheel window at the west end resembles a fully-blown
flower. The clerestory windows are majestic and graceful. First, right
hand, is the chapel built by the Cardinal de Bourbon and his brother
Pierre, son-in-law of Louis XI. The two windows bearing their portraits,
and the curious wheel window at the end, are admirable. The soffits of
the arches and the vault of the roof are richly
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>

decorated. In the N. transept is the now useless clock made by Nicholas
Lippeus of Basel in 1508. The founder of the See of Lyons was St.
Pothinus, an Asiatic Greek, who preached in this city <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 177, and sealed his doctrines with his blood.
Adjoining the S. aisle is the Manécanterie, 11th cent., formerly the
bishop’s place, now the music school for the choristers.</p>

<p>A little farther down the river is the church of St. George (rebuilt)
occupied in the 13th cent. by the <b>Knight Templars</b>. Above the
cathedral is the Palais de Justice, planned by Baltard, the architect of
the large market, the Halles Centrales of Paris. In front is a colonnade
of 24 Corinthian columns. The hall is spacious and elegant, but the
court rooms around it are too small. The bridge higher up&mdash;the Pont
de Nemours&mdash;leads directly to the church of <b>Saint Nizier</b>,
with the façade towards the bridge and the chancel towards the Rue de
l’Hôtel de Ville. The handsome portal surmounted by twin spires is by
Philibert Delorme, a&nbsp;native of Lyons, and dates from the 16th cent.
The rest of the building belongs to the 15th cent. In the interior a
broad triforium with heavily-canopied window-openings surrounds the
church. The vaulting shafts expand in a curious way over the roof. In
the chapel of the south transept is a statue of Mary by Coysvox. At the
foot of the pier in this transept a trap-door opens into the crypt, 10th
cent. At the south side of the Palais des Arts is St. Pierre,
a&nbsp;modern edifice, with a beautiful portal of the 11th cent., all
that remains of the original church.</p>

The sepulchral inscriptions form a most interesting series of epitaphs,
in many instances most tender and affecting. Indeed, reading these
records of the love of kindred among the ancient heathen, from the
Augustan age upwards, one would incline to believe that the Romans of
that day were already “feeling after” Christianity. In the left corner
of the court on entering is the stair which leads up to the
Archæological Museum and the Picture Gallery, both on the first floor.
Up on the second floor is the collection of paintings by the “peintres

inscribed portions of the harangue of Claudius before he became emperor,
imploring the senate to grant to Lyons, his native city, the title of a
Roman colony. The letters are beautifully cut and easily legible. This
table was discovered in 1528 on the heights of Saint Sébastien.
Germanicus, and the Emperors Claudius, Marcus Aurelius, and Caracalla,
were also born in Lyons. The father of St. Ambrose was for some time
prefect of Lyons. In the same room is a decree of the Egyptian pontiffs
in hieroglyphics. There is a good collection of seals, coins, enamels,
armour, carved work, and bronzes, as well as some necklaces, bracelets,
rings, and coins, part of a treasure buried during the Roman period on
the Fourvière heights, and discovered in 1811. The numismatic
collection, 30,000 pieces, includes a series of the coins struck at
Lyons from 43 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> to 1857. Adjoining
and on the same floor is the Picture Gallery, contained in six small
rooms, of which the first three contain the Flemish and Dutch schools,
the next two the Italian and Spanish schools, and the sixth the French
school. They are all carefully labelled. Among the pictures which
represent the Flemish school are works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Teniers,
Van Dyck, Holbein, Stein, Dietrich, Breughel, Wouvermans, and Ruysdael.
The Italian and Spanish schools are represented by Canaletto, Sasso
Ferrati, Guercino, Zucharo, Murillo, Ribera, Zurbaran, etc. On the floor
of the fourth room is a remarkably perfect mosaic pavement, 5½ yards by

This picture, originally in the church of San Pietro at Perugia, was
presented by Pope Pio VII. “in attestato del suo affetto é della grata
sua rimembranza per la citta di Lione.” The lower part of the picture is

"lyons_hotel_ville" id = "lyons_hotel_ville"><b>Hôtel de Ville</b></a>,
built in 1665 by Maupin, at the cost of £320,000. The facade, flanked by
domed square pavilions, is 160 ft. wide, while the building itself is
1150 ft. long. The back part, fronting the theatre, is the Préfecture.
From the centre rises the clock-tower, 157 ft. high. On the façade over
the entrance is an equestrian statue of Henri IV. in bold relief. Within
the vestibule, to the right and left, are colossal bronze groups, by the
brothers Coustou, representing the Rhône and the Saône. They stood
originally under the statue of Louis XIV. in the Place Bellecour.</p>

<p>In 1642 Cinq Mars and De Thou were executed, by order of Richelieu,
in the Place des Terreaux. In 1794 the revolutionary tribunal, sitting
in the Hôtel de Ville, guillotined so many people in this square that it
became so flooded with blood as to render it necessary to send the
executioners to Brotteaux, near the present railway station, to finish
this wholesale slaughter of Frenchmen by Frenchmen.</p>

containing the great terrestrial globe made at Lyons in 1701, indicating
the great African lakes, the rediscovery of which has been one of the

manuscripts,&mdash;about 600 of the printed works being incunabula, and
25 of the MSS. belonging to the Carlovingian period.</p>

between 11 and 4. The great hall contains, in high glass cases,
specimens of silk, satin, velvet, crape, and lace, arranged according to
centuries from the 13th and 14th to the 19th. The 19th, which is by far
the richest and most beautiful, is in two cases, representing the first
and the latter half of the century. This collection is choice and highly
artistic, displaying miniature portraits, superb embroidery, and lovely
designs in charming colours, woven in the loom. At the entrance to the
hall is a portrait (about 13 in. by 10) of Jacquard, in a sitting
posture, woven in white and black silk, like those at St. Etienne. Also
the Will of Louis XVI. In the next room are looms and models of looms
from the time of Louis XI. The models are so perfect that each contains
part of a web woven in it. Among them is the model of the famous loom
made by Jacquard in 1804, by which a single workman was enabled to
produce elaborate fabrics as easily as the plainest web, and by merely
changing the “cartoons” to make the most different textures on the same
loom. Near the loom is the first <a name = "lyons_sewing_machine" id =

<p>The cases round the inmost room are devoted to the natural history of
silk&mdash;displaying every variety of the silk butterfly, Bombyx mori,
as well as of the allied species; cocoons of every kind and in every
condition; eggs and caterpillars at every stage of their existence; and
hanks of raw silk from every part of the world where it is produced.
Adjoining is a room with drawings, many by the great masters.</p>

<p>Formerly Lyons manufactured only high-class silks, but the demand for
these having been for some years on the decrease, the manufacturers, to
hold their place in the market against especially their Créfeld rivals,
have had to turn their attention to cheaper stuffs. This in some measure
is owing to the rapid and violent changes of fashion,

with an occasional alteration, it was worn for years.</p>

<p>In the street behind the east side of the Bourse are the large

the other, containing the entrance, to the Rue de l’Hôpital, is the
<a name = "lyons_hospital" id = "lyons_hospital"><b>Hôtel Dieu</b></a>, or
general hospital, with 1500 beds, founded in the 6th cent. by Childebert
and Ultrogotha his queen. The present building is principally the work
of Soufflet, the architect of the Pantheon in Paris. Of the beds, about
1300 are free, the remainder pay from 1¼ fr. to 12 frs. per day. The
rooms are lofty and well ventilated. The principal female wards are
arranged in the form of a cross, with an altar in the centre under the
small dome, in such a position that all the patients can see it from
their beds. From the large dome extends the principal ward of the men,
containing 100 beds, and a smaller one on the other side. The sick are
tended by nuns. The hospital has a house on the heights of the
Croix-Rousse, near the terminus of the rope railway, and another at
Oullins for incurables.</p>

<p>In the first court left of the large court, Dr. Young buried Mrs.
Temple, the Narcissa of his <i>Night Thoughts</i>, who died in 1730 at
Montpellier, but was there refused burial. At that time what is now a
built-up court was a cemetery. Fifty years ago it was a garden, now it
is covered with buildings. All trace of the grave has disappeared.</p>

<p>Near the entrance to the hospital is the church, 18th cent., richly
decorated. In a chapel, left, is the enormous gilt shrine, in 5 stages,
of Sainte Valentine.</p>

<p>Farther down the Rhône is the Hospice de la Charité, founded in 1531,
on the occasion of a great famine. It receives the poor of both sexes
who have reached 70; sick children under 15, and young women about to be
mothers. The church was built in 1617.</p>

columns which stood formerly in the temple of Augustus. They were
originally 2, but were cut into 4. The fresco paintings in the apsidal
chapels are by H.&nbsp;Flandrin, a&nbsp;native of <b>Lyons</b>. To the
right is the sacristy or chapel of Saint Blandina, in which a short
stair leads down to the crypt and the dungeons, one on each side, where
Pothinus, first bishop of Lyons, and Blandina, a&nbsp;converted slave,
were kept before being tortured and put to death in <span class =

Antoninus, the implacable enemy of Christianity. The crypt, about 12 ft.

<p>The <a name = "lyons_park" id = "lyons_park"><b>Parc de la
Tête-d’Or</b></a>, or park of Lyons, is situated at the N.E. extremity
of the city, between the Brotteaux railway station and the left bank of
the Rhône. It measures 282 acres, and contains, besides an abundant
supply of varied walks, a&nbsp;large and excellent botanic garden with
hothouses, a&nbsp;lake with islands inhabited by aquatic birds, and a
dairy farm, whose produce is sent every morning into town for sale.
Adjoining the park are the rifle-butts and the racecourse. In the
Boulevard du Nord is the Guimet Museum, containing a collection of
objects from the extreme east, to facilitate the study of the history,
religions, and customs of the inhabitants of that part of the world. The
institution publishes essays and translations.</p>

<p>By the western side of the Brotteaux railway station are the large
barracks of the Part-Dieu and the Fort des Brotteaux.</p>

<p>Lyons employs 70,000 looms and 140,000 weavers in the manufacture of
silk; and here, as at St. Etienne, the work is principally performed on
the domestic system in the dwellings of the master weavers, each of whom
has usually from two to six or eight looms, which, with their fittings,
are generally his own property. Himself and as many of his family as can
work are employed on these looms, aided frequently by one or more
<i>compagnons</i>, or journeymen, who inhabit chiefly the suburb of La
Croix Rousse, to the north of the town, and that of Fourvières, on the
Saône. The silk merchants supply the silk and patterns to the owners of
looms, who are entrusted with the task of producing the web in a
finished state. The mean annual value of the silk goods manufactured is
estimated at £15,000,000.</p>

<span class = "headnote">The Dyeing of Silk&mdash;Origin of

<p>The dyeing of the silk is also an important branch of manufacture.
Many experiments had been made to bring this art to perfection, and

in particular to discover a dye of perfect black that would retain its
colour. This a common dyer of Lyons at last invented, for which he
received a pension, besides being made a member of the Legion of Honour.
Prior to this the black dye which was used changed in a few days to a
brown, and came off the stuff when it was hard pressed by the hand.
Another improvement which was made consisted in procuring a silk of a
permanent white colour. The eggs of the worm which produced this silk
were brought from China, not, however, with the desired success. The
worm was afterwards purchased from a merchant of Alais, and distributed
in the southern departments of the country, where now a large number of
persons are engaged in silkworm hatcheries. The produce of white silk is
now very considerable and of great importance in the manufacture of
gauzes, crapes, and tulles. Extensive chemical works, breweries,
foundries, potteries, engineering works, printing establishments, and
hat factories represent the secondary industries of Lyons. A&nbsp;large
trade is carried on in chestnuts brought from the neighbouring
departments, and known as <i>marrons de Lyon</i>.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting, and at the same time easiest excursions
from Lyons is to Mont Ceindre, 4&nbsp;m. from Lyons. Take the omnibus
starting from the Rue de la Platière to the village of St.
Cyr-au-Mont-d’Or, 3¼&nbsp;m., time 1½ hr., by a road always ascending.
Fare, ½ fr. The omnibus office at St. Cyr, the inn, and the café, are on
a wide terrace commanding an extensive view. The village, pop. 2000, is
poor and dirty, and built on the side of the hill. To ascend Mont
Ceindre walk from the omnibus office up to the new church, whence ascend
by the telegraph posts, and then turn to the right. The ascent

and descent can be done easily in 80 minutes, in time to go back to
Lyons by the returning coach. On the top of Mont Ceindre are some
houses, an old hermitage, and a chapel surmounted with a statue of Mary.
The view is grand, embracing the valleys of the Rhône and the Saône, the
towns of Bugey and Beaujolais, the mountains of the Forez, the Dauphiné,
and the Alps. Mont Ceindre, 1532 ft. above the sea; Mont Verdun, 2020

Cheese.</a></span>
The wine is thin, but the cheese is one of the best and most celebrated
in France. They are soft, round, and flat, about 5 inches in diameter
and half an inch thick, like round pancakes. They are made from a
mixture of cow and goat’s milk, and are said to derive their peculiar
flavour from the vine leaves on which the goats feed during a
considerable portion of the year. The cheeses of Mont Dore (likewise
famous) are thicker and smaller in diameter, and sold in small boxes.
The coach, on its way from Lyons to St. Cyr, passes by Roche-Cardon,
a&nbsp;favourite retreat of J.&nbsp;J. Rousseau. Another easy excursion
is to the Ile Barbe. Take any of the mouches (penny boats) going up the
Saône to Vaise station. Here change into the penny boat going to St.
Rambert, a&nbsp;rather dirty little town on the right bank, 1½&nbsp;m.
above Vaise. Opposite, and connected by a bridge, is the town of Cuire.
In the centre of the river is the Ile Barbe, across which the bridge
passes. On the island there are a few uninviting country-houses, and the
tower of a chapel (private property) of the 12th cent. The sail is the
best part of the excursion, not the island.</p>

<p>Outside, opposite the N. transept, is Le Pendentif, a&nbsp;sepulchral

flat dome. Close to the “Place des Clercs” is the Maison des Têtes,
built in 1531, covered with mutilated statues and medallions under
canopy work. The medallions, bosses, and groining in the passage leading
into the court are in a much better state of preservation.

<p class = "sidetrip">
Ardèche should not be visited till June, and not later than September.
In the villages and hamlets in the pastoral districts most of the best
houses are inns or auberges, where a bed can be had, and abundance of
fare, in the shape of fried potatoes, butter, milk, eggs, coffee, bread
often of rye, and hard salt pork sausages. The national dish is potatoes
sliced very thin and fried with butter. They make also a pleasant soup
of herbs mixed with potatoes. The numerous inns are required for the
accommodation of guests during the fairs, of which each hamlet has at
least 2, while the larger villages and towns have from 4 to 8, besides
market-days. One of the prettiest sights in Ardèche is to see the people
flocking from every direction along the winding mountain roads to the
village where the fair is being held&mdash;many on foot driving small
parcels of pigs, sheep, goats, or cattle, or carrying baskets full of
eggs, cheese, and butter, and often an old hen; others with carts loaded
with potatoes; others travelling comfortably in their char-à-bancs; and
others on horseback, the women as well as the men being astride.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
Many of the inns, and even of the owners, are at first sight forbidding,
but after a little kindly conversation the aspect of things improves
rapidly. In the higher regions the agricultural products are potatoes
and hay. In the next zone are wheat, chestnut, walnut, apple, pear, and
cherry trees, cultivated on terraces supported by low stone walls of
rough unhewn stones. Vineyards are in the lowest zone, on the sunny side
of the mountains. The cattle are of a goodly size, mostly cream-coloured
and light brown, with large bones and white horns generally tipped with
black.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
At the fairs, besides every kind of country produce, girls and grown-up
women offer their hair for sale. The best do not yield above 8s., and
many only 2s. 6d. or 3s. When the bargain is made a woman shears it off
in the same way as sheep are shorn, leaving only

a little in front. It is all over in two minutes, twisted into a hank,
and thrust into a sack. Instead of receiving money, they usually take
the value in cloth and ribbons. The standard occupation of the females
during their long winters is lace-making.</p>

partly on the steep sides of a high hill. At the foot, in the
market-place, are the parish church and the Bibliothèque. Straight up
from the bridge by the R. des Cordeliers, and a flight of 116 steps, is
the entrance to the poor church of N.&nbsp;D. de la Garde, attached to
the “Asile” for young children. A&nbsp;little higher up are the hospital
and church. Above the “Asile” is the entrance to the enclosure, on which
stands a huge structure, partly Roman and partly the remains of a castle
which was added to it in the 13th cent. The highest side is 170 ft.
above the ground, and the other three 148 ft., ascended by 260 steps.
Although so high, the view is limited by the high side, into which
visitors are not admitted. The concierge lives below in the town, near
the hotel. The best way up the hill is by the first narrow street, left
from the hotel, the Rue de la Carrière, which continue to a stone

buildings of Saint Tiers, founded in the 9th cent. The best parts are
the wall and square tower near the Mairie. The remains of the church are
within the court of a stable. Near it is the little parish church, 12th
and 13th cents. Saou is visited principally on account of the beauty of
the narrow valley of the Vebre, between two ranges of wooded mountains,
from 4000 to 5000 ft. above the sea, with sand and limestone strata
piled up into vertical cliffs and twisted into strange fantastic forms.
It is 8&nbsp;m. long, and from a few yards to 2&nbsp;m. wide. At the
commencement or west end, and on the right or N. side of the stream, is
the Roche Colombe, 4595 feet above the sea, and opposite, on the other
side, is the Roc, an isolated cliff like the shaft of a column. Mt.
Colombe has also a columnar cliff, and at the base a house called the
Donjon de Lastic, 14th cent., and a little farther down a square house,
with two round turrets, called the Château d’Eurre. The best parts of
the valley are this entrance and the east end, or its termination, where
the Roche Courbe or Veillou rises to the height of 5324 ft. above the
sea, and on which is the source of the Vebre. At the foot of Mt.
Pomeyrol, about a mile from the entrance, the valley becomes so narrow
that there is scarcely sufficient room for the stream to pass through.

S.E. Die, on the Drôme, is in a small plain surrounded by mountains, of
which the most remarkable is Mont Glandaz, 6648 ft. above the sea,
flanked by great buttress cliffs. On the top is an undulating plateau,
covered with <i>small</i> stones and grass; 5 hrs. required for the
ascent. At the foot of the mountain is the rustic but not uncomfortable
establishment of Sallières-les-Bains; pension per day, with baths,
9&nbsp;frs. The treatment is called “Sudations résineuses.” The bath
resembles a large oven, in which, after having been heated with resinous
fir-wood, the patients sit as in a Turkish bath. Open from 15th June to
15th September. The landlord is likewise proprietor of a large part of
Mt. Glandaz, whence he receives his supplies of fir-wood. On the top of
a hill on the other side of the Drôme is a similar establishment, called
the Martouret, pension 12 frs. The way to it strikes off the main road
opposite the eminence, on which is the chapel of Notre Dame, commanding
a very good view of the valley. At the entrance into Die from Crest, at
one of the old gateways, a&nbsp;road strikes off to the left, which
makes the tour of the ruins of the castle, amidst vines and mulberry
trees. At the other end of the town, near the viaduct, is a much better
gateway or Roman triumphal arch, fronting the “Place” St. Marcel. The
parish church has been rebuilt, excepting the narthex.</p>

Temple Protestant next the hospital. Nyons, surrounded by high
mountains, is famous for its mild springs, and therefore eminently
fitted for those returning from the Riviera. The orange and palm do not
grow here, but abundance of mulberry, almond, fig, peach, and pear
trees. In the oak forests are remarkably fine truffles. Silk mills and
the preserving of fruit and truffles supply the principal industries.
The old town, called Les Forts, is built on an eminence partly
surrounded with its old walls garnished with square towers, 14th cent.
The vieux château, or centre tower, has been converted by the curate
into a chapel surmounted with an image of the “immaculately conceived.”
The part of the town below is called Les Halles, whose dirty streets are
bordered with thick heavy arches. The rest of the town, extending to the
Aigues, is called the Bourg. The bridge, built in 1341, is of one arch
and considerably higher in the centre than at the ends.</p>

constant, and never breaks out into gusts. To go to the cave, commence
from the foot of the tower of the church and ascend by the Rue
Pousterle, having on the left the old town-walls. Beyond the last tower
a path strikes off to the right, which take, and ascend to a small
chapel on the top of the ridge, passing at about half-way a pavilion.
Or, if preferred, continue the road from the tower to the part of the
ridge where there is a gap; whence take the path at the back of the
ridge leading to the chapel. Those who have ascended by this latter way
retrace their steps from the chapel by the same path for 116 yards;
while those who have come by the other go 116 yards beyond the chapel.
Then about 30 yards to the left of the path will be observed the thin
ledge of a rock overlying a small cavity, which is the entrance to the
Pontias hole, of great depth, but otherwise of insignificant dimension.
Among the neighbouring calcareous strata are several crevices. The view
of the valley of the Aigues from this hill is very beautiful. The ascent
takes 35 minutes.</p>

east by the valleys of the Aigues and Blème, bounded on both sides by
high mountains. Time, 7 to 8 hours. Fare, 7½ frs. Most of the towns
passed are at a considerable height above the road, and sometimes on
account of the steepness of the banks cannot be seen from it. The first
village passed is Les Piles, situated on the road 3¾&nbsp;m. from Nyons,
and 3½&nbsp;m. from the gorge “Des 30 Pas,” one of the excursions from
Nyons. A&nbsp;little farther E. is Curnier, on a hill on the S. side of
the river, here crossed by a bridge. Then follows Sahune, also on a hill
on the S. side of the river. The gorge now becomes very narrow and the
mountains precipitous, and, having passed under Villeperdrix, the road
crosses to the S. side of the river and arrives at the station for St.
May, where there is an inn, H.&nbsp;Marius. St. May itself is high up on
the opposite side of the river. The cemetery is on the point of a lofty
precipitous rock. After St. May the diligence crosses the river to the
village of Rémusat, 17&nbsp;m. E. from Nyons on the Oule, at its
junction with the Aigues. The diligence now returns to the S. side of
the river, which it crosses for the last time at Verclause, 22&nbsp;m.
from Nyons, and then proceeds to Rosans, 3½&nbsp;m. farther or
15½&nbsp;m. from Serres. From Rosans commences the ascent of the low Col

is of a yellowish sandstone, 75 ft. high, 64 wide, 27½ deep, and
consists of 3 arches, of which the centre one has a span of 17 ft. and
each of the other two a span of 10 ft. The soffits are ornamented with
six-sided sculptured panels. By the side of each arch is a grooved
Corinthian column. Over the small arches are sculptured trophies in the
shape of shields, boars, bulls, rostra, ropes, masts, dolphins, arrows,
etc. Over the main arch, on each side, is a group representing a
combat.</p>

<p>At the other end of the town are the cathedral and the Roman theatre
at the foot of the hill, crowned with an image of Mary. The
<b>Cathedral</b> of Notre Dame, 12th cent., is small, and resembles in
style the churches of the S.W. of France, of which the cathedral of
Perpignan is the great type. No transepts nor triforia. Lofty chapels
between the buttresses, and over the arches diminutive clerestory
windows. A&nbsp;plain and ugly square tower, in this case, at the east
end. Adjoining is the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville, with a statue to
“Raimbaud&nbsp;II., Comte d’Orange, vainqueur à Antioche et à Jérusalem
en MXCIX.” In the promenade of the town, the Cours St. Martin, is a
statue to the Comte de Gasparin, a&nbsp;writer on agriculture, and a
native of Orange; where also he died in 1862. At the foot of the hill,
overlooking the town, are the grand and imposing ruins of one of the
most perfect Roman theatres. It is built in a semicircular form, has a
façade 118 ft. high and 384 ft. wide. The wall is 13 ft. thick, composed
of huge blocks of stone. The semicircular wall consists of five stages,
and included accommodation for 6500 spectators. The building has
recently been repaired and cleared of a quantity of rubbish.</p>

<span class = "headnote">Prince Of Orange and Orangemen.</span></a></p>

<p>In the 11th cent. Orange became an independent countship, probably
under Raimbaud&nbsp;I., whose successor, Raimbaud&nbsp;II., has just
been noticed. On the death of Philibert of Châlons, last of the third
line of princes, the inheritance fell to his sister’s son Count René
(Renatus) of Nassau-Dillenburg, who remaining childless chose as his
successor his cousin William&nbsp;I., stadtholder of the United
Netherlands. The title “Prince of Orange” was consequently borne by the
stadtholders Maurice, Frederick-Henry, William&nbsp;I.,
William&nbsp;II., and William&nbsp;III. After the Revolution in Ireland
of 1688, the English-Protestant party were designated Orangemen, from
the title of their leader, William&nbsp;III., Prince of Orange. Louis
XIV. seized the principality of Orange in 1672, but lost it by the peace
of Ryswick. On the death of William&nbsp;III. there were two
claimants&mdash;John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, designated by
William’s will, and Frederick&nbsp;I, King of
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
<!-- png 085 -->
Prussia, who claimed to be nearer of kin, and to have been appointed by
the will of Frederick-Henry. Thereupon Louis XIV. declared the
principality a forfeited fief of the French crown, and assigned it to
the Prince of Conti. The Parliament of Paris decided that this last
prince should have the <i>dominium utile</i>; and its finding was
confirmed by the treaty of Utrecht (1713), which, however, left the
title and coat of arms to the King of Prussia, who is still styled
Prince of Orange (Prinz von Oranien). John William Friso, however, also
took the title, and his successors the stadtholders and kings of the
Netherlands have all been designated princes of Orange-Nassau. Vast
numbers of silkworms are reared at Orange. Coach daily to <a href =

W. from Le Buis, and 4&nbsp;m. S. from Villedieu. Old or high Vaison is
on the left side of the Ouvèze, and new Vaison on the right. Both are
connected by a Roman bridge of one arch of 48 ft. span, having at the
left side a more elongated curve than at the right. The old town, with
its squalid streets and poor houses, covers the sides of a hill crowned
with the ruins of a castle built by Raymond&nbsp;VI., Count of Toulouse,
in 1195. It is a plain rectangular edifice, 20 yards square, with a
small square tower at one of the angles. A&nbsp;little below is the
parish church with round and early pointed arches and square tower at
S.E. end. The view from the terrace is beautiful.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The most ancient and most interesting buildings are in new Vaison, and
very near each other. Take the Villedieu road to just without the town,
where a byeway on the right leaves the main road at an acute angle.
Continue this byeway to two arches, which indicate the site of the Roman
theatre. The chapel seen to the N.W. is <a name = "st_quenin" id =
"st_quenin"><b>St. Quenin</b></a>, while a little beyond is the
cathedral. The amphitheatre, or “les arènes” as they call it, is built
on the same plan, and in a similar position, as the theatre of Orange,
but far less perfect. Besides the two arches, there exist still five
tiers, but all the stone seats are gone, excepting those on the lowest
stage. Now it has become a vineyard and an orchard. Beyond, by a narrow
road, is St. Quenin, of which the east end is Roman, and may date from
the 4th cent., but the rest belongs to the 10th. The east end, or
apsidal termination, is in the form of an equilateral triangle, with an
attached fluted Corinthian column at the apex, and also at each of the
angles of the base. One of the pillars has figures on the capital. The
neat little round-headed window on each side of the triangle is
evidently a later addition. Bishop Quenin died in 578.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
Of the <b>Cathedral</b> the best part is also the outside. Under the
eaves of the roof of the nave run a dentil moulding, and a frieze of
medallions connected by an undulating line of foliage. The walls are
pierced by small round-headed windows resting on spiral colonnettes.
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
<!-- png 086 -->
The frieze of the aisles is plainer. In the interior, early pointed
arches of great span, rising from four massive piers of clustered
pilasters on each side of the nave, support a narrow-vaulted roof, also
pointed. This part of the church dates from the 12th or 13th cent.; but
the chancel, with its two Roman pillars, and arcade of blank arches on
colonnettes, is much earlier. Over the little chapel, at the N.E. side,
rises an elegant square tower. Next the tower is a very beautiful
cloister, 11th cent., bearing some resemblance to the cloister of St.
Michel in Brittany. It is 22 yards square, surrounded by an arcade of 13
arches on colonnettes in couples 3½ ft. high. At the corners is either a
massive stone pier, or the stone hewn into 5 colonnettes. All the Roman
antiquities Vaison has retained for itself are under this corridor. The
most perfect piece of sculpture is a skull. On the top of the hill
opposite the castle stands an image of the “Immaculée” on the capital
and part of the shaft of a Roman column. (Map <a href =

Rigaud of the Abbot Rancé, and a handsome staircase. In the centre of
the Place is a bronze statue of the benevolent Malachie d’Inguimbert.
From this “Place,” up the narrow street, the first public building is
the church of St. Siffrein, dating from 1405.
<span class = "sidetrip">
The square tower, with octangular cupola, attached to the north side of
the chancel, was part of a former church constructed in the time of
Charlemagne. The stair (89 steps) up to the roof, whence there is a
pleasing view, commences at the south side of the chancel, outside.
Among the pictures in the interior of the church, the best is a
“Salutation” by the Flemish painter Andreas Schoonjans. Behind the
pulpit is a picture by Mignard representing Mary giving some of her milk
to St. Bernard. At the commencement of the chancel, near the cupola, is
the chapel in which the reliquaries are kept. Among them are the skull
and bones of St Siffrein, and the nail that pierced the right hand of
J.&nbsp;C. on the Cross. In the chancel is a “Coronation” of Mary
painted on wood, 15th cent., and behind the altar another “Coronation”
by P.&nbsp;Veronese. In the foreground are Saints Laurence and Siffrein.
Adjoining is the Palais de Justice, 1640, with frescoes and a crucifix
in the “salle des assises.” Within the court, right hand, is a Triumphal
arch, erected by Diocletian between 284 and 305, 30 ft. high (but
originally higher), 25½ ft. wide, 14½ ft deep, and 10 ft. span. On the
N. side, between two attached fluted columns, is, in bold relief,
a&nbsp;Latin cross with the arms at obtuse angles. On each side stands a
prisoner, with his hands behind him, chained loosely to the cross. From
the cross are suspended swords, horns, and pouches. On the south side is
a similar cross, but not in

of a tree. From the top hangs the dress of a warrior.</span></p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The continuation of the street from the church leads to the Porte
d’Orange, surmounted by a square tower 120 ft. high, of which only three
sides exist. It was built by Innocent&nbsp;VI., who also surrounded the
town with the ramparts, which now form beautiful Boulevards. From the
boulevard in front of the gate are seen to the left the canal aqueduct,
to the right the town water aqueduct, and in the distance, between the
two, beyond a smaller ridge, Mont Ventoux, extending from N.W. to S.E.,
with a slight bend. The aqueduct which brings water to Carpentras
crosses the valley of the Auzon by 48 massive arches. The canal, which
by irrigation fertilises the surrounding country, extends from the
Durance to the Ouvèze, a&nbsp;distance of 43 miles, and cost £90,000. In
the principal Boulevard, nearly opposite the manufactory of preserved
fruits of Eysseric, is the building containing the library and museum.
The library contains a valuable collection of manuscripts, explained in
a printed 4to volume, several rare incunables, and above 4000 vols., for
which there is not sufficient accommodation.

In the “Musée” are a few good pictures, and Roman statuettes in bronze

Carpentras. The gem of the antiquities is an Egyptian-Aramaic limestone
slab, 4th or 3d cent. <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, 19¼ in.
long by 13½ wide and 1 thick, divided into three compartments by narrow
borders. In the principal compartment stands a young woman with uplifted
hands before Osiris, who is seated in front of a table on which are
sacrifices. Behind Osiris stands Isis. Below, in the second compartment,
is the embalmed body of the deceased, attended by the jackal-headed
Anubis and the hawk-headed Horus. Below the body are the four customary
funeral vases. Below this, in the third compartment, is an Aramaic
inscription in four lines, of which the last two are injured. The first
French opera was written in Carpentras by the Abbot Mailly in 1646.
<span class = "headnote float"><a name = "truffles" id = "truffles">
Truffles.</a></span>
Truffles or tuberous mushrooms are black, dark gray, violet-coloured, or
white. The last variety, principally found in the N. of Italy, has the
smell of garlic. About Carpentras, and in the department of Vaucluse,
they are black, and are found from 4 inches to 1&nbsp;foot below the
ground, at the extremities of the fibrous roots, both of the common and
of the evergreen oak. The season for gathering them is from November to
the end of March, after which those which remain become soft and
decompose. They are at their best in January, when the rind is black,
hard, and rough, and the inside mottled black and white. In size and
shape the best resemble small round potatoes, of which the largest may
weigh ½ lb., although few are of that size. They are sought by means of
dogs and swine, both of a peculiar breed; the sow being the more
dexterous of the two, and continues efficient for its duty for upwards
of 21 years. It scoops out the earth with its powerful snout in a
masterly manner faster than any dog can do. When just about to seize the
truffle, the attendant thrusts a stick between its jaws, picks up the
truffle himself, and throws to the sow instead two

Two coaches daily from Carpentras to Buis-les-Baronnies, 23&nbsp;m.
N.E., by Malaucene 10&nbsp;m. N.E. The road from Carpentras, in crossing
the N.W. extremity of the Ventoux chain, passes by the village of Le
Barroux on a hill crowned with the ruins of a castle, 15th cent. At the
foot of Mont Ventoux, 5&nbsp;m. S. from Vaison and 13&nbsp;m. S.W. from
Buis, is <a name = "malaucene" id = "malaucene"><b>Malaucene</b></a>,
1000 ft. above the sea, pop. 3000. <i>Inn:</i> Hôtel de Cours, in a
picturesque neighbourhood, of which there is a good view from the
calvary on an eminence in the town. At about ½&nbsp;m. from the inn is
the spring Groseau, gushing forth from the base of a lofty calcareous
cliff, crowned with the ruins of the chapel of Groseaux, 11th cent. The
stream that issues from the spring is soon strong enough to set in
motion the machinery of paper, silk, and flour mills. Any one may visit
the silk mills. In 1345 Petrarch ascended Mont Ventoux from Malaucene.
The ascent from this place is more difficult, but more picturesque than
from Bedoin and requires 2 hours more. On the side of the mountain are
the springs&mdash;Angel, 3826 ft.; Puits de Mont-Serein, 4774 ft.; and
Font Filiole, 5866 ft.</p>

The road from Malaucene to Buis follows the picturesque valley of the
Ouvèze. The most important village passed on the way is Mollans, with,
in the neighbourhood, a&nbsp;great cave, beyond which is a deep lake.
Shortly before arriving at Le Buis are seen, on an eminence, the bronze
statue of Bishop Trophime, and beyond, the cliff of St. Julien. No
public vehicle goes farther than Le Buis, although the road is good the
length of the railway between Marseilles and Grenoble, passing St.
Euphemie 7&nbsp;m. E., St. Auban 10&nbsp;m. E., Montguers 11¼&nbsp;m.

<p>The present <a name = "avignon_palace" id =
"avignon_palace"><b>Palace</b></a>, commenced by Benedict XII. in 1336,
and finished by Gregory XI. in 1370, is an ugly huge structure,
consisting of plain walls 100 ft. high and 14 thick, strengthened by
long ungainly buttresses. Above the entrance, composed of a low archway,
are the arms of Clement&nbsp;VI.; and higher up, on two oriel turrets,
the balcony from which the Popes blessed the people. Within the gate is
the Cour d’Honneur, a&nbsp;vast quadrangular space between flat walls,
pierced by from 3 to 4 stories of windows, not on the same level nor of
the same size. From the court ascend the Escalier d’Honneur,
a&nbsp;groined staircase, of which the steps were formerly of marble, to
the Salle Consistoriale d’Hiver, with an elegantly-groined roof. Before
this hall was divided into two, it was 52 ft. high, 65½ wide, and 170
long. From it we enter the Salle d’Armes, with mural paintings by Simone
Memmi of Sienna. Ascending higher the grand staircase, we pass on the
left the small window for the Spies, and then go along a narrow lobby
tunnelled in the wall, to a succession of large bare halls, the Galerie
de Conclave, the Salle des Gardes, the Salle de Reception, and then
enter the Tour St. Jean, containing the Chapelle du Saint-Office,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
<!-- png 093 -->
or the chapel of the <b>Inquisition</b>, with mural paintings. In the
story immediately below is the chapel of the Popes. From the Tour St.
Jean, after passing through a large hall, we enter an octagonal room,
gradually narrowing towards the centre, till it forms a chimney-tower,
called the Tour Strapade. Some say this was the torture room; but it is
evidently more suited for a kitchen, which in all probability it was.
Adjoining is the Glacière, into whose underground cellars, now built up,
the democrats of 1791 flung the bodies of 60 men and women they had
murdered. From this we enter again the Place d’Honneur by the Tour
Trouillas, in which Rienzi was imprisoned five years, bound to a chain
fixed to the roof of his cell. During the time of the Popes, from 1305
to 1234, and till 1793, the half of Avignon was occupied by
ecclesiastical edifices, which tolled daily 300 bells, and had among
them a daily succession of religious processions.</p>

<p>From the palace the road leads up to the highest part of the town,
the <a name = "avignon_rocher" id = "avignon_rocher"><b>Rocher des
Doms</b></a>; commanding a magnificent view, and laid out as a public
garden, with in the centre a statue of Jean Althen, who introduced, in
1766, the culture of the “garance,” the <i>Rubia tinctoria</i>, now
superseded, for the dyeing of red. From this terrace a stair leads down
to the Rhône near the <a href = "#avignon_benezet">Bridge Bénézet</a>
(see page 63). In the middle of the river is the Ile de Barthelasse, and
on the other side are the Tour de Philippe le Bel, the town of
Villeneuve, and above it the Fort St. André. On the promenade is the
Cathedral <a name = "avignon_cathedral" id =
"avignon_cathedral"><b>Notre-Dame-des-Doms</b></a>, 194 feet above the
Rhône, approached by a stair called the Pater, because originally it had
as many steps as there are words in the Lord’s Prayer. This church has
undergone many changes, and belongs to various periods. The portal and
lower part of the tower are of the 10th cent., and are due to
Fulcherius. The nave is two centuries later. The apse was added in 1671.
The most remarkable part of the structure is the cupola, terminating in
an octagonal lantern, and supported on pendentive arches. It bears
traces of frescoes painted in 1672. In the sanctuary is the marble
throne used by the Popes, in the sacristy the Gothic mausoleum of Jean
XXII., and in one of the side chapels the tomb of Benoit XII. In the
third chapel (right hand) is a Madonna in white marble, by Pradier. The
sacristan is generally in the small room next the main entrance. Fee, ½

entering is the tomb of the painter Pierre Mignard, d.&nbsp;4th April
1725, aged 86, and third chapel on same side is a virgin and child in
wood by Coysevox. To the left of the entrance is an ancient and elegant
marble baptismal font. At the foot of the short street St. Agricol, in
the Rue Calade, is the Oratoire, built in 1730. At No. 65 of the Rue
Calade is the <a name = "avignon_musee_calvet" id =
"avignon_musee_calvet"><b>Musée Calvet</b></a>, containing a valuable
collection of art treasures open to the public on Sundays from 12 to 4,
and a library and reading-room open every day except Sunday. Against the
wall of the inner court is the tomb of the donor of this museum, Claud
François Calvet, d.&nbsp;25th July 1810, in his 82d year. On the right
is the monument erected by Sir Charles Kelsall in 1823 to Laura de Sade,
dead of smallpox in 1348, and buried in the church of the Cordeliers
(see <a href = "#page62">p.&nbsp;62</a>). On the other side is the tomb
of the military strategist Folard, a&nbsp;native of Avignon. In the
outer court, and in the rooms and passages on the ground-floor, are
Roman altars, monuments, milestones, torses, amphoræ, and 170 Latin
inscriptions, found in the neighbourhood, but chiefly from Orange and
<a href = "#vaison">Vaison</a> (p.&nbsp;53). Among the sculptures in
relief, one represents a Roman chariot drawn by two horses with their
hoofs shod. There are 27 Greek inscriptions, 3d or 4th cent., from
Venice. The statuary and sculpture of the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance have been gathered principally from the suppressed churches
and convents. The most noticeable are: the mausoleums of Pope
Urbain&nbsp;V., of Cardinals Lagrange and Brancas, and of Marshal
Palice. Within railings are: Cassandra by Pradier, a&nbsp;faun by Brian,
and a bather by Esparcieux, all in the finest white marble. Upstairs is
a valuable collection of Roman glass and bronzes, and 20,000 coins and
medals, including a complete set of the seals and medals of the Popes
during their residence at Avignon, and the seal used by the Inquisition
while here. There are nearly 500 pictures, and a collection of drawings,
including the original sketches of Horace Vernet. Most of the pictures
have the artists’ names affixed. Those

marble busts of Horace and Carle are by Thorwaldsen. In the centre of an
inner room, containing the medals and engravings, is the famous ivory
crucifixion, 27 inches long, of one piece, excepting the arms,
a&nbsp;chef-d’œuvre of the sculptor Guillermin in 1659. It is said that

Continuing down the R.&nbsp;Calade to the other side of the
R.&nbsp;Petrarque or de la République, we have on the right the Museum
of Natural History in the church St. Martial, 15th cent. The greater
part of the specimens were bequeathed by M.&nbsp;Requien, d.&nbsp;1851,
and of them the most interesting are those connected with the
neighbourhood, such as the flamingo and beaver of the Rhône, and the
fossils from Aix. In the eastern continuation of the R.&nbsp;Calade, at
No. 62 R. des Lices, is the Collége <a name = "avignon_st_joseph" id =

admitted. It is to the left of the entrance. Of the tomb there are no
vestiges, having been destroyed along with the church by an infuriated
mob in 1791. On the E. side of the R.&nbsp;Petrarque, by the narrow
R.&nbsp;Prévot, is the church of <a name = "avignon_st_dedier" id =

chapel right from entrance, a&nbsp;relief in marble representing Christ
bearing his cross, executed by Francesco in 1481 at the request of King
René. Opposite, over second arch, 36 ft. above the floor, is a stone
pulpit with a sculptured pendant. The grave of St. Bénézet is under a
plain slab in the middle of the nave, in front of the high altar. Near
St. Dedier is the Hôtel Crillon, 17th cent.; and to the east of the
Place de l’Hôtel de Ville is the church of St. Pierre (9&nbsp;in plan),
1520, with an elaborately-sculptured door and pulpit. The pictures about
the high altar are by N.&nbsp;Mignard, J. and P.&nbsp;Parrocel, and
Simon de Châlons. From the S.E. corner of the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville,
the R. des Marchands and its continuation the Rues Saunerie and

who died at Avignon in the Hôtel de l’Europe, Nov. 3, 1858.
A&nbsp;touching epitaph, recounting her virtues, occupies the whole
surface of the top slab. From the Porte St. Lazare, a&nbsp;walk may be

chapel to the left, the mausoleum of Innocent&nbsp;VI., under a lofty
elaborately-sculptured canopy, rising in pinnacles to the roof. Upstairs
is the picture gallery, in two rooms. The most remarkable picture
belongs to the 15th or 16th cent., painted on wood, and represents two
subjects, Purgatory and the Judgment Day, apparently by two different
artists. Although stiff, the design is admirable, and all the heads,
even the smallest, are carefully executed. But the gem is the most
charming and bewitching portrait by Mignard of Mme. de Ganges attired as
a nun. She was born at Avignon in 1636, and when only 13 married the
Marquis de Castellane, with whom she frequented the court of Louis XIV.,
where she was called La Belle Provençale. After her husband’s death she
married the Marquis de Ganges, with whom she returned to Avignon, where
her sorrows commenced, caused by the conduct of her two brothers-in-law,
the Abbot and the Chevalier de Ganges, whose unlawful passion she
steadfastly resisted. At last the exasperated abbot having made her
drink poison, she threw herself out of the window, and while lying on
the ground in the agony of death, the chevalier pierced her seven times
with his sword. These two monsters were condemned by the parliament to
be

Mignard are: Jesus before the Doctors, an Annunciation, and a St. Bruno.
Fee, 1&nbsp;fr., given to the hospital. In the parish church, built in
the 14th cent, by Cardinal Arnaud de Via, there is nothing
extraordinary. Near it are the ruins of the
Chartreuse-du-Val-de-Bénédiction, and on an eminence Fort André, now
inhabited as a walled village. The omnibus for Avignon starts every hour

Villeneuve.</p>

<p>Avignon is very much exposed to different winds, especially the
Mistral, yet perhaps they are necessary, for, according to the adage,
“Avenio ventosa, cum vento fastidiosa, sine vento venenosa,” the odours
from the drains in some of the streets being very offensive.</p>

<p>Till July 26, 1793, Avignon belonged to the Papal See, when it was
forcibly taken possession of by the Republican army under General
Cartaux, who owed his victory to the skill of his captain of artillery,
the young commandant Napoleon, who afterwards remained nearly a month in
this town for the establishment of his health, in No. 65 Rue Calade,
opposite the Musée Calvet, where he wrote “Le Souper de Beaucaire.”</p>

from the Pont-d’Avignon station on the west side of the Rhône. Those
wishing to visit the Pont-du-Gard on the way should take their tickets

luggage, it is better to take the tickets only to Remoulins; where,
without loss of time on arriving, take other tickets to the
Pont-du-Gard, leaving the luggage behind. Time will generally be saved

the right bank of stream, but for the house and garden of Petrarch take
the left side, crossing the bridge. On the left side, against a cliff
near the cloth mill, is a small house on the site of Petrarch’s, of
which it is a copy. Before it, is still a piece of what was Petrarch’s
garden. On the other side of the Sorgue is a cigar-paper mill. There is
a little hotel at Vaucluse, the Hôtel Petrarch et Laure. Under a
stupendous cliff 1148 feet high is the source of the river Sorgue, the
placid <a name = "fontaine_vaucluse" id =

diameter&mdash; “a&nbsp;mirror of blue-black water, so pure, so still,
that where it laps the pebbles you can scarcely say where air begins and
water ends.” During floods, however, the cavern being no longer able to
contain the increased volume, the water rushes over in a cascade into
the bed below. The poet’s modest house stood at the foot of the rock
crowned by the ruins of the castle in which lived his friend Cardinal
Philippe de Cabasole. Petrarch himself gives the following description
of the site:&mdash; “On one side my garden is bounded by a deep river;
on another by a rugged mountain, a&nbsp;barrier against the noon-day
heats, and which never refuses, not even at mid-day, to lend me its
friendly shade; but the sweet air reaches me through all obstacles. In
the distance a surly wall makes me inaccessible to both man and beast.
Figs, grapes, walnuts, almonds&mdash;these are my delights. My table is
also graced with the fish that abound in my river; and it is one of my
greatest pleasures to watch the fishermen draw their nets, and to draw
them myself. All about me is changed. I&nbsp;once used to dress myself
with care; now you would believe me a labourer or a shepherd. My house
resembles that of Fabius or Cato. I&nbsp;have but a valet and a dog. The
house of my servant adjoins my own. I&nbsp;call him when I want him, and
when I have no more need of him he returns home.”</p>

<p>On the 6th of April 1327 Francesco Petrarca saw in a church of
Avignon Laura the daughter of Audibert de Noves, for whom he conceived a
romantic but hopeless attachment. Incessantly haunted with the beautiful
vision of the fair Laura, he visited in succession the south of France,
Paris, and the Netherlands, and after an exile of eight months returned
to bury himself in the solitude of Vaucluse.</p>

<i>Hotels:</i> Nord; Forum; near each other in the Place du Forum. Arles
is situated on the Rhône, near the Camargue, in a marshy place, as its
original name, Arelas, from the Celtic words, “Ar lach,” damp place,
indicates. It is said to have been founded 900 years before Marseilles,
700 years before Rome, and 1500 before the birth of Christ. The ramparts
and walls rising from the public gardens and the Boulevard des Aliscamps
are chiefly the work of the Emperor Constantine, who came to Arles with
his family and mother, Saint Helena. He built by the side of the Rhône a
superb palace, called afterwards “de la Trouille,” because opposite a
ferry-boat, which was pulled or dragged from one side of the river to
the other. Of this palace little more remains than the attached tower La
Trouille, constructed of alternate layers of brick and stone. On the 7th
August 312 his wife Faustina presented him with a son,
Constantine&nbsp;II., who succeeded his father in May 357. He commenced
the Forum, but was shortly after killed in battle defending himself
against his brother Constance, who usurped the throne and finished the
Forum. All that remains of this formerly splendid edifice are the two
Corinthian columns, with part of the pediment encrusted into the wall of
the Hôtel du Nord. It occupied the site of the Place du Forum, called
also the Place des Hommes, because labourers and men-servants used to be
hired in this “Place.”</p>

<p>In the Place de la République is the Hôtel de Ville, built in 1675 on
the site of the Roman baths constructed by the Emperor Augustus. The
spacious vaults under the Hôtel du Nord formed probably a part of these
baths, although in later times they seem to have been used as an
ossuary.</p>

<p>Almost adjoining the Hôtel de Ville is the church of St. Anne,

some of the long lead pipes, with the name of the plumber, “C. Canthius
Porthinus fac.,” which helped to bring water from the fountain at the
foot of the hill on which Baux stands. At the inner end, right hand, is
a torse of Mithras of white Pharos marble, 3 ft. 2 inches high, found in
1598 on the site of the Roman Circus. A&nbsp;serpent is coiled round the
body, and between the coils are the signs of the Zodiac. In the opposite
corner is an altar in Carrara marble to the good goddess “Bonae-Deae,”
found under the church La Major. On the front face is a garland of oak
leaves and acorns, and 7 inches distant from each other two human ears.
Near it is a good head of Augustus, and a mutilated one of Diana. About
the centre of the room is a recumbent figure of Silenus, with a wine
skin under his arm.</p>

<p>In the centre of the “Place” is the monolith obelisk, 49 ft. high,
hewn by the Romans from the quarries of Esterel. It stood originally in
the Circus at the S.W. corner of the town; but of it no vestiges
remain.</p>

statues of apostles and saints separated by pilasters. In the tympanum
is Christ, the judge of the world, with the symbols of the Evangelists.

<p>Passing from the cloister into the street, and turning to the left,
we arrive at the Theatre, commenced during the dominion of the Greeks,
and finished before the Christian era. In the centre of this grand ruin,
originally 335 ft. in its greatest diameter, stand two Corinthian
columns 30 ft. high, and the base of other two, which formed part of the
proscenium. Opposite them is the semicircular space for the spectators,

two stages of

arches, and in each stage 60 arches. From around the arena rise 43 tiers
of stone seats, capable of containing 23,438 spectators. The stone steps
leading up to them were 1½ ft. high and 2 ft. 3 inches long. There were
besides above 150 rooms for the gladiators and men connected with the
theatre, and 100 dens for wild beasts. The three towers were added by
the Saracens in the 8th cent. Bull-fights are given in the building,
when a multitude of spectators, as in the time of the Romans, fill the
galleries. A&nbsp;splendid view of the amphitheatre, the city, and of
the commencement of the delta of the Rhône, is had from the western
tower. The entrance into the amphitheatre is by the north gate. The
doorkeeper lives in a house a little to the left of the gate. This grand
ruin should, if possible, be visited by moonlight; yet during the day
the beautiful masonry is more easily examined. It is the great sight in
Arles, and it is better to omit all the others than to do this one
hurriedly.</p>

<p>The Camargue or Delta of the Rhône, commencing at the outskirts of
Arles, is a triangular plain of 180,000 acres extending to the
Mediterranean, bounded on the west by the Petit Rhône, and on the east
by the Grand Rhône. It contains small villages and large farms, with
extensive vineyards and grazing ground for cattle, sheep, and horses. It
is best visited by the steamboat sailing <a href =

Arles: Elysei Campi. Trophimus.</span></p>

<p>S.E. above the Promenade is the church of St. Cesaire, 9th cent., on
the site of a temple of Jupiter. From this to go to Alyscamps, walk down
the Boulevard Alyscamps to the canal Craponne, where turn to the left.
The first ruin passed is an old entrance into what was the domain of the
monastery of St. Cesaire. The Avenue of Alyscamps is lined on each side
by 33 large stone coffins with lids, and 120 smaller coffins without
lids. This, the <a name = "arles_elysei" id = "arles_elysei"><b>Elysei
Campi</b></a>, an ancient Roman cemetery, is now divested of all its
valuables and statues, of which a few are in the museum. As
J.&nbsp;C.Himself is said to have appeared during the consecration of
the cemetery, it was believed that at the resurrection it would be
especially favoured by Him; hence the efforts made by so many to bury
their friends here. It is said that up to the 12th cent. coffins with
their dead, and money for the funeral expenses, floated down the Rhône,
of their own accord, to be buried in this privileged spot. At the end of
the avenue is the church of St. Honorat, on the site of the chapel
founded by <a name = "arles_trophimus" id =
"arles_trophimus">Trophimus</a> the Ephesian, one of St. Paul’s
converts, who was sent to Arles to preach the gospel and to put an end
to human sacrifices. Among the first things he is
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
<!-- png 106 -->
said to have done was to consecrate the Alyscamps and transform it thus
from a heathen into a Christian burial-place, and add to it a little
chapel. An old Arles writer alleges on his own authority that Trophimus
dedicated this chapel to Mary, who was then alive. After labouring 36
years in this diocese he died on the 29th of November 94, and was buried
in the little chapel he himself had built. Among the successors of
Trophimus were Ambrose in 160, who remained here 20 years; Augustine in
220, who died 10 years afterwards; Jerome in 230, who also died 10 years
afterwards; Marcien in 252, the originator of the Novatien sect; and St.
Cyprien in 253. Saint Virgil, one of the successors, founded in 601 the
church of St. Honorat beside the chapel of Trophimus. The present church
dates only from the 12th to the 14th cent. The best and oldest part,
excepting the foundations, is the apsidal termination, which is
semicircular, with 4 pilasters and a small window in the centre to give
light to the officiating priest. Over it rises a neat octagonal belfry
in two arcaded stages. Under the chancel is a small crypt. The keeper
calls a small chapel at the left hand corner of the chancel, the chapel
of Trophimus.</p>

consists of a straggling village between the Rhône and the basin of the

the geography of this desolate flat region of land and water, exposed to
every wind, it is necessary to ascend the “tour Saint Louis,” whence the

like a map. The only villages seen in the vast expanse are Fos, on a

A&nbsp;poor and ancient town on the canal of Aigues-Mortes, near the
Petit Rhône. The abbey church, founded in 1116, is considered a good
specimen of Byzantine architecture. The façade consists of a bald wall
with a plain tower on each side. Between these towers are three
semicircular recessed portals, below an entablature resting on two
single and two double columns. The capitals are Corinthian, but the
pedestals (considerably effaced) consist of lions and grotesque animals
in uncouth positions. Behind them, on the piers of the arches of the
portals, stand in bold relief statues of apostles and saints, separated
from each other by pilasters. The interior, consisting of a nave and two
aisles, is 290 ft. long, 88 wide, and 62 high. In the N. aisle a stair
of 33 steps leads down to the lower church, with semicircular arches on
short massive piers. From the centre 7 more steps descend to the tomb of
St. Gilles. All the characteristics of this church are equally well
represented in St. Trophime of Arles.</p>

connected with it by a navigable canal. <i>Inn:</i> Saint Louis. It is
of great historical interest, and is surrounded by the most perfect old
embrasured wall in France, built in the form of a parallelogram, 596
yds. long by 149 yds. broad. It is 36 ft. high, and is flanked by 15
towers. On the western side rises the famous round tower of Constance,
96 ft. high and 72 in diameter, containing two vaulted superimposed
circular chambers, used by Louis XIV. and Louis XV. as prisons for their
Protestant subjects of both sexes, who here suffered such cruelties that
the Dutch and Swiss Governments were roused to interfere in their
behalf, and even Frederic the Great is said to have interceded for them,
but in vain. From the platform at the top of this tower is the highly
interesting view of the flat country at the mouth of the Rhône, whence
the traveller may judge for himself whether the sea has, or has not,
receded from the town since the time of Saint Louis&mdash;we think not.
Both the tower of Constance and the walls are the work of Saint Louis,
who had a predilection for Aigues-Mortes, as he considered it the most
suitable place in his kingdom from which to embark for Palestine. On
25th August 1248, after having heard mass in the church
Notre-Dame-des-Sablons (fronting his statue), he and his Queen
Marguerite sailed from Aigues-Mortes on their first expedition to
Palestine. On the 3d of July 1270 he again sailed from the same place;
and on that same year, on the anniversary day of his first expedition,
the 25th of August, he perished among the ruins of Carthage. 4&nbsp;m.

in a hollow, surrounded by trees, the botanical part; and between these
two divisions the arboretum. Opposite the Botanic Gardens is the once

Cathedral of <b>Saint Sauveur</b>, built in the 11th cent., partly on
the foundations of a temple to Apollo. The tower, 195 ft. high, was
built in the 15th cent., and the chancel in 1285. The façade was
commenced in 1476, and the beautiful sculpture on the great entrance
door executed in 1503. It is generally covered by a plain outer door. In
the interior to the right is the Baptistery, an octagonal chapel with
six antique marble and two granite Corinthian columns about 30 ft. high,
each shaft being of one stone. The ornamental sculpture on the panels
and in the spandrels is by Puget. On the same side are two triptychs,
one by Crayer, “Mary worshipped by Saints,” and the

centre Moses and the burning bush, with Mary up in a clump of trees. On
one wing is King René on his knees, attended by the Magdalene, St.
Maurice, and St. Anthony; and on the other wing is the king’s second
wife, Jeanne de Laval, attended by her patron saints. On the outside of
the shutters are the angel Gabriel and Mary.</p>

On each side of the chancel is an organ case, but only the one on the

representing scenes in the life of J.&nbsp;C. Both pieces are said to
have belonged to St. Paul’s of London. Among the relics the church
possesses are: the skull of St. Ursula, the arm of one of her 11,000
virgins presented by Nicolas&nbsp;V. in 1458, a&nbsp;rib of St.
Sebastian presented by King René, and three thorns from the crown of our

the size and shape of walnuts. The better kind, “Gallissons,” are flat

reputed to have a very fine fruity flavour. The reason alleged
is&mdash;the trees being small the berries are gathered, or rather
plucked, by the hand before they are quite ripe. Where the trees are
large, as in the more favoured parts of the Riviera, the fruit must be
allowed to ripen to allow of its being shaken down by long poles. The
trees are pruned in circles, leaving an empty space in the centre.</p>

situated on an eminence rising from the Veyradère, which rushes past in
a dark ravine below. Pasture being the principal crop cultivated, the
mountain sides have no terraces. Four great fairs are held annually
here. The winter is long and severe, but from June to October the
weather is pleasant. The staple occupation of the females is lace-making
on a pillow with bobbins. The design is on paper fixed to a short
cylinder, and is further indicated by pins with coloured glass heads.
The linen thread is given them by the merchants, who pay them at the
rate of from 2d. to 4½d. the yard, according to the breadth of the lace,
from 2 to 4 inches. A&nbsp;most industrious lace-maker can earn

semicircular arch with 6 mouldings resting on four short columns with
sculptured capitals. Above the tympanum and also over the large
rectangular window are rude mosaics. Under the eaves of the roof runs a
string moulding of grotesque sculpture, representing men and animals. In

pinnacle fountain in the centre. From this ascend by the R. des Tables
to the flight of 40 steps, leading up to the tetrastyle portico in front
of the church. Forty-one more steps lead up through this portico to the
portal of the west façade of the church, built up in the 18th cent., and
having against it an altar to Mary. The oblong flat stone at the base of
the table of the altar belonged to a dolmen which stood on this hill
from the earliest times, and is called the “Pierre aux fièvres,” from
its once supposed power of curing of fever those who lay upon it.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
From this altar a flight of 27 steps ascends to the left, to the
cloisters, while the flight to the right of 32 steps ascends to one of
the two south side entrances into the church. The other south side
entrance, called the Porte du Fort, 12th cent., presents an
extraordinary composition of the florid Byzantine style. On one side of
it is the square belfry in 5 stages, commenced in the 11th cent., on the
other is the bishop’s palace, and in front a small terrace. At the north
side of the church is the Porte St. Jean, 12th cent., preceded by an
arch of 28 ft. span. The cloisters are in the form of an oblong square,
with 9 arches on the long sides, and five on the short, supported on
square piers with attached colonnettes. The south side is the earliest,
beginning of the 10th cent., and the western the most recent. The
church, built in 550, received a succession of alterations up to 1427,
when it was injured by an earthquake. In 1846 it was repaired and
restored. The interior consists of eight square compartments, each,
excepting the 7th, covered with a dome resting on four massive piers.
Above the 7th rises an octagonal lantern tower. Under it is the high
altar, with a replica of the miracle-working image,<a name = "tag_1" id

picture represents a numerous concourse of church and civic dignitaries
carrying in procession the original image to make it stay the plague,
which raged in Le Puy in 1660. The picture opposite represents the
Consuls of Le Puy, attired in red, thanking the image for its
protection. In the sacristy is the Théodulfe Bible, 9th cent. Near the

du Pay to build a small house and oratory in the wildest and most
inaccessible part of the forests on their domains, where he and his
companions might lead a more austere life than in their monastery at
Brioude. This house, built in 1043, by degrees attained the goodly
proportions of a convent, which the peasants called La Chaise-Dieu, or
Casa-Dei. Clement&nbsp;VI., formerly Roger de Beaufort, abbot of
Chaise-Dieu, born in the village, commenced, shortly after his elevation
to the papal throne, to build at his own expense a church on the site
formerly occupied by the oratory of St. Robert. The work was continued
and finished by his nephew, Gregory XI., in 1420, by whom are the façade
with the two short massive square towers, 128 ft. high, and the
horse-shoe staircase of 41 steps. The tower, 30 ft. square and 110 high,
attached to the S. point of the apse, was built by the abbot de Chanac
to protect the church and convent, which he surrounded with a wall. The
gateway, part of the wall, and part of the old convent, are just under
the tower. Adjoining the remains of the abbey buildings are the
cloisters, a&nbsp;parallelogram, 140 ft. by 77, of which only two sides
remain. The long side has nine low, wide, massive, mullioned and
traceried unglazed windows, and the short side four.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The interior of the church is 301 ft. long, surrounded by 22 tall plain
slender octagonal piers, from which springs the groining, which spreads
itself over the stone-vaulted roof. The nave is 44 ft. wide, and the
aisle on each side 15, all the three roofs being of the same height. The
church is lighted by long narrow pointed windows, one between each two
columns, excepting at the apsidal termination, where a triangular
projection affords space for three windows. The tracery has little
depth, and is of the simplest design. The choir, 131 ft. long, is
separated from the nave by an ugly rood-loft. It contains 144 carved
cedar-wood stalls, and above them on both sides 17 pieces of Arras
tapestry, 16th cent., from designs by Taddeo Gaddi. In the centre is the
mausoleum of Clement&nbsp;VI. His white marble effigy, with the hands
folded and the papal Triregnum on the head, reclines on an altar table
of black marble.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
On the N. side of the screen of the choir, just behind the pulpit, is
the “Danse Macabre,” or dance of death, a&nbsp;favourite subject with
artiste from the 12th to the 14th cent. The ironic grin and jocund gait
of the skeleton death contrast vividly with the dismayed and demure
expression of the great and mighty kings, priests, and warriors, young
and old, gay and sedate, he marshals off, in the midst of their projects
and plans, to the dark silent grave. Under it is the sadly mutilated
mausoleum of Queen Edith of England, wife of the unfortunate Harold.
Near it is the more perfect mausoleum of the last abbot of La

landlord of the Louvre can procure either a guide for the Pont,
2&nbsp;frs., or for the caves, 5&nbsp;frs., or the boatman for sailing
down the Ardèche. The Pont d’Arc is a natural bridge across the Ardèche,
composed of a calcareous rock, pierced with a span of 180 ft., through
which the river flows majestically. The soffit of the arch is 100 ft.
high, but the total height of the parapet is 230 ft., and 48 thick.
There are several rocks similar to this in France, but this one is
unrivalled in size, and in the beauty and grandeur of the surrounding
scenery. A&nbsp;lovely little plain, covered with vines, peach and
mulberry trees, is enclosed by the circle of vertical cliffs 500 ft.
high, which at one part extend over the river. In these cliffs are great
stalactite caves, approached by iron ladders from the top. One of them
is 490 ft. long and 100 ft. high. Vallon is famous for black truffles,
honey, and chestnuts. Pigs are used for finding the truffles. They are
better than dogs, because they are not so apt to be carried off by other
scents, as, for example, when a hare or a partridge suddenly appears
upon the scene. (See under Carpentras, <a href = "#page54">page

of a tunnel, 4¼&nbsp;m. long, which here and there widens out into
spacious lofty caverns hung with stalactites. Some parts are very steep,

from side to side. There were four entrances, one facing each of the
cardinal points of the compass. The interior contained 32 rows of seats
in 4 zones, capable of accommodating from 18,000 to 20,000 spectators.
The lowest zone corresponded to the dress circle, the others to the

to have been the founder. The Visigoths converted it into a fortress,

"nimes_fort"><b>Fort</b></a>, built by Louis XIV., now the town prison.
On the western side of the fort are the remains of the reservoir,
<i>castellum divisorium</i>, which received the water brought by the
canal from the aqueduct of the Pont-du-Gard. This canal still brings
water to the town reservoir, on the opposite or east side of the
fort.</p>

<p>In the year of Rome 788 a strong wall was built round Nîmes, 7 ft.
high, pierced with 10 gates; of which there still remain two; the Porte
d’Auguste, originally fronting the road to Rome, now at the E. end of
the Temple Protestant, and the Porte de France at the extremity of the
Rue Carrètérie. (See <a href = "#map101">plan</a>.)</p>

<p>The ancient name of Nîmes is Nemausus, one of the cities of Gallia

Narbonensis, and the capital of the Volcæ Arecomici. As early as the
reign of Augustus it was a “colonia,” and possessed in the days of
Strabo the “<b>Jus Latii</b>,” and therefore was independent of the
Roman governors. Its most notable product then was cheese, which was
exported to Rome; now it is raw silk, for which it is the principal
emporium in the south of France. The wines of Nîmes are in repute in
Paris, particularly the Costière and the St. Gilles, called also Vin de
Remède. Both deteriorate after the sixth year in bottle. Nicot, who
introduced tobacco into France, and Guizot, the minister of Louis
Philippe, were born at Nîmes.</p>

Pont-du-Gard.</span></p>

<p>13½ miles from Nîmes is the <a name = "pont_du_gard" id =
"pont_du_gard"><b>Pont-du-Gard</b></a>, built by the Romans in the reign
of Augustus as part of the aqueduct, 25&nbsp;m. long, which, from the
neighbourhood of <a href = "#uzes">Uzès</a> (page 99), brought the
waters of the Eure and Airan to the reservoir beside the fort, of which
only vestiges now remain. This “Pont,” which spans the valley or banks
of the river Gardon, consists of three rows of arches, whose total
height above the bed of the river is 156 ft. The two lower stories are
formed of hewn stones, placed together without the aid of any cement;
but the mason work underneath the channel of the third or top story is
of rough stones cemented, by which all filtration was prevented. The
first or lowest row consists of six arches, with a span of 60 ft. each,
except the largest, which has 75 ft. The second row consists of eleven
arches of the same dimensions as the first, and the third of 35 arches
of 15 ft. span. A&nbsp;stair from the right bank of the river leads up
to the watercourse above the topmost tier of arches. In the striking
boldness of its design this bridge exhibits a decided improvement and
superiority over all the other Roman aqueducts. The arches are wider,
and the piers in proportion lighter, and had the same principle been
extended so as to have formed it of one single row from top to bottom,
it would have equalled in the skill and disposition of its materials the
more judicious and more elegant structures of modern times (see <a href
= "#roquefavour">Roquefavour</a>, p.&nbsp;77). Take ticket to
Pont-du-Gard Station. But if with luggage, and on the way to Avignon,
take ticket to Remoulins, where leave the luggage, and take another
ticket to the Pont-du-Gard, which having visited, walk back to Remoulins
station, where take ticket for Pont Avignon (see under <a href =

on the line to Paris by Rodez. There are no towns of importance on this
line, though some parts, especially towards Vigan, are very picturesque.
27&nbsp;m. from Vigan, and 31 from Nîmes, is Quissac, pop. 1800,
junction with line to Lezan, 9&nbsp;m. N., and thence 4½&nbsp;m. E. to
Mas des Gard, on the Nîmes and Alais line. 9&nbsp;m. W. from Lezan is
St. Hippolyte-Le-Fort, pop. 4500, on the sluggish Vidourle. From this
the line goes westward by La Cadière to Ganges, 9½&nbsp;m. from Vigan,
on the Hérault, 595 ft. above the sea, pop. 5000, H.&nbsp;Croix Blanche,
omnibus at station. The most pleasant town on the line. 2½&nbsp;m.
farther is Jumène, 682 ft. above the sea, pop. 3000, with coal and iron
mines. 4&nbsp;m. from Vigan, at Le Pont, 666 ft. above the sea, the line
crosses the Hérault, and entering the picturesque valley of the Arre
follows the course of that river to Vigan, pop. 6000. <i>Inns:</i>
Voyageurs; Cheval Blanc; both in the “Place,” near the statue of the
Chevalier d’Assas, born at Vigan in 1733, and “Mort glorieusement à
Clastercamp à 27 ans.” Vigan on the Arre, an affluent of the Hérault, is
860 ft. above the sea, in a hollow between steep mountains, with
terraces of vineyards, olive, mulberry, fig, and chestnut trees to
nearly their summits. The town consists of narrow, crooked, badly-paved
streets. The hospital was founded in 1190. In the promenade near the
post office are some old chestnut trees, disfigured with knots. In the
neighbourhood are several coal-pits, worked, however, with difficulty,
on account of the water they contain. Nearly a mile westward is the
Fontaine Isis, the source of the water-supply of the town. Beside it are
the cold sulphureous springs of Cauvalat.</p>

N., in a very picturesque region, on the Hérault, in a deep wooded
valley between the Aigoual mountains towards the N., and the Espéron
mountains towards the S.&nbsp;The principal source of the Hérault is a
little higher, towards the W., at Séreyrède. From Valleraugue the ascent
is made in about 2½ hours of Mt. Aulas, 4665 ft. above the sea, the
culminating point of the Espéron, commanding a magnificent view. The
source of the Dourbie is just a little to the S. of Valleraugue, and of
the Tarn to the N., but on the other side of the Aigoual. Excellent
fishing, botanising, and geologising in this neighbourhood.</p>
