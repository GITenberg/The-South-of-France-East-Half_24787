<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Riviera</span> is a strip of land
extending 323 miles along the coast of the Mediterranean at the foot of
the Maritime Alps and their off-shoots. It is usually divided into two
portions&mdash;the Riviera from Hyères to Genoa, 203 miles long; and the
Riviera from Genoa to Leghorn, 112 miles long.
<span class = "headnote float"><a name = "riviera_climate" id =
"riviera_climate">
Temperature.</a></span>
The milder and more frequented of the two is the former&mdash;the
Western Riviera&mdash;which has been subjected to most careful and
minute meteorological observations, and the various stations classified
according to their supposed degree of temperature. Yet in the whole 203
miles the difference may be said to be imperceptible. No one station in
all its parts is alike, the parts of each station differing more from
each other than the stations themselves. Yet each station has some
peculiarity which suits some people more than others; this peculiarity
being more often accidental and social&mdash;such as the people met
with, the lodgings, the general surroundings, and many other little
things which exercise a more powerful influence upon the health and
well-being of the mind and body than the mere fractional difference of
temperature. None of the protecting mountains of any of the stations are
sufficiently high, precipitous, and united to ward off the cold winds
when the higher mountains behind are covered with snow. All the ridges
have deep indentations through which the cold air, as well as the
streams, descends to the plain. Hence no station is exempt from cold
winds, and all delicate persons must ever be on their guard against
them&mdash;the more

sunny and beautiful the day, especially in early spring, the greater is
the danger. All the stations suffer also, more or less, from the famous
<b>Mistral</b>, a&nbsp;north-west wind, which in winter on the Riviera
feels like a north-west wind on a sunny summer day in Scotland. The mean
winter temperature (November, December, and January) of Hyères,
considered the coolest of the winter stations, is 47°.4 Fahr., and of
San Remo, considered the mildest, 48°.89 Fahr. The coldest months are
December and January. With February the temperature commences to rise
progressively. Throughout the entire region bright and dusty weather is
the rule, cloudy and wet weather the exception.
<span class = "headnote float"><a name = "riviera_vegetation" id =

Vegetation.</a></span>
“In December wild flowers are rare till after Christmas, when the
long-bracted orchid, the purple anemone, and the violet make their
appearance. These by the end of January have become abundant, and are
quickly followed in February by crocuses, primroses, and pretty blue
hepaticas. Meanwhile the star-anemones are springing up in the
olive-woods, with periwinkles and rich red anemones. In March the
hillsides are fragrant with thyme, lavender, and the Mediterranean
heath, to which April adds cistuses, helianthemums, convolvuli,
serapiases, and gladioli.” &mdash;<i>H.&nbsp;S. Roberton</i>. There is a
much less quantity of wild flowers now than formerly. The date-palm
flourishes in the open air. Capital walking-sticks are made of the
midrib of the leaf. Among the trees which fructify freely are the
orange, lemon, and citron trees, the pepper tree (<i>Schinus molle</i>),
the camphor tree (<i>Ligustrum ovalifolium</i>), the locust tree
(<i>Ceratona siliqua</i>), the Tree Veronica, the magnolia, and
different species of the Eucalyptus or gum tree and of the true Acacia.
In marshy places the common bamboo (<i>Arundo donax</i>) attains a great
height; while the <i>Sedum dasyphyllum</i>, the aloe, and the Opuntium
or prickly-pear, clothe the dry rocky banks with verdure. The most
important tree commercially is the olive, which occupies the lower part
of the mountains and immense tracts in the valleys. The higher
elevations are divided among the cork tree (<i>Quercus suber</i>), the
Maritime, Aleppo, and umbrella pines, and the chestnut tree. The
Japanese medlar (<i>Eriobotrya japonica</i>) is common in the orchards,
flowers in December, and ripens its fruit in May. With the exception of
the orange, lemon, and cherry, all the other orchard trees ripen their
fruit too late for the winter resident.</p>

<p>On the Riviera generally, but especially in Hyères, St. Raphael,
Grasse, and Menton, board and lodging in good hotels can be had for 8s.
or 9s. per day, which includes coffee or tea in the morning, and a
substantial meat breakfast and dinner, with country wine (vin

ordinaire) to both. In some boarding-houses (Pensions) the price per day
is as low as 6s. If two are together, especially two ladies or a
gentleman and his wife, an excellent plan is to take a furnished room,
which, with a south exposure and good furniture, ought to cost about £2
per month. They can easily prepare their own breakfast, and they can get
their dinner sent to them. If the party be numerous, apartments should
be taken, which vary from £2 to £30 per month. For the season, from
October to May, furnished apartments are let at prices varying from £18
to £100. As a general rule it is best to alight at some hotel, and,
while on the spot, to select either the pension or apartments, as no
description can give an adequate idea of the state of the drains nor of
the people of the house. A&nbsp;maid-servant costs nearly £1 per month,
a&nbsp;cook about one-half more, but they are not easily managed. Fluids
are sold by the litre, equal to nearly a quart of four (not six) to the
gallon. Solids are sold by the kilogramme, or, as it is generally
called, the kilo, equal to 2 lbs. 3¼&nbsp;oz.</p>

<p>Bread is about the same price as in England. The best beef and mutton
cost from 1s. 10d. to 2s. the kilo. A&nbsp;good chicken 2s. 6d. Eggs
when at their dearest cost 1½d. each. Excellent milk costs 4d. the
litre. The best butter 3s. 2d. to 3s. 6d. the kilo. Of French cheese
there are a great many kinds, all very good. Among the best are the
Roquefort and the fromage bleu, both resembling Stilton, and cost from
2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. the kilo.

Fish are dearer than in England. The best caught off the coast are: the

are often served up at dinner in the hotels. The cardon tastes like
celery, but the salsifis has a bitter flavour. The potatoes are of good

Advantages.</span></a></p>

<p>Before commencing to treat in detail the different stations of the
Riviera, “some of the general advantages of the invalid’s life in this
region must be noticed. The chief of these is the amount of sunshine
which he enjoys for weeks and even months together, when the sun
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110" id = "page110"> </a>
<!-- png 148 -->
often rises in a cloudless sky, shines for several hours with a
brightness and warmth surpassing that of the British summer, and then
sinks without a cloud behind the secondary ranges of the Maritime Alps,
displaying in his setting the beautiful and varied succession of tints
which characterise that glorious phenomenon of the refraction of light,
a&nbsp;southern sunset; when he imparts to the rugged mountains a
softness of outline and a brilliancy of colouring which defy
description. In the early stages of phthisis, and especially when the
patient is young and active-minded, struck down by overwork or sudden
exposure, this cheering influence is most beneficial. It is of great
importance that, while taking the needful care of himself, he should not
degenerate at an early age into a hopeless valetudinarian, especially as
an every-day increasing mass of evidence warrants us in believing that
under the influence of medicine and climate a large number of these
patients gradually recover their health and lead useful lives, and, with
due care, lives of no inconsiderable duration. Patients should never
neglect to consult a doctor on their first arrival, as his experience
and advice with regard to lodgings, food, etc., are of great value, and
may often prevent them from falling into bad hands, or settling in
unhealthy localities.” To these remarks of Dr. Williams may be added,
that patients should bring with them a letter from their physician
describing their case and the treatment he thinks should be adopted.</p>

<p>The best time for walking and driving is between 9 and 12, as then
there is rarely either wind or dust. For invalids requiring quiet sunny
walks there are no stations on the whole coast so suitable as Hyères and
Bordighera.</p>

in 1862 in the Greek style, has on the pediment and peristyle
bas-reliefs by Guillaume, representing Justice, Force, Prudence, etc.
The outer hall, the “Salle des Pas-Perdus,” is surrounded by 16 columns

upper and a lower church. The dome over the apse is 48 ft. high. The
interior of the church is lined with Carrara marble, but the pilasters
and columns are of marble from Africa and the Alps. Over the high altar
in the low church is the miracle-working image of Notre Dame. It is
about 6 ft. high, stands on a pedestal of olive wood, is hollow, and
made of a kind of stucco (carton-pierre) silvered over, excepting the
face and hands of both it and the child. It weighs 1 cwt. 1 qr. and 14
lbs. On the high altar in the high church is a replica, nearly all of
silver. The walls are covered with expressions of gratitude to it, and
with pictures illustrating the manner in which its miraculous
interposition was displayed.</p>

<p>From the streets Cannebière and Noailles other handsome streets
ramify, such as the Rue de Rome and the Cours Liautaud. Just where the
Cours Liautaud leaves the Rue Noailles is the <a name =

grammar-school, and in the neighbourhood (marked 11) La Bibliothèque et
l’École des Beaux Arts, forming together a palatial edifice off the
Boulevard du Musée, 177 ft. long by 164 ft. wide. On the ground-floor
are the class-rooms, and on the first story, the library, the collection
of medals, and the reading-room, 131 ft. long by 19½ wide. Among the
medals are 2600 belonging to Provence. The library contains 95,000 vols.

monasteries in Christendom, founded in 420 by St. Cassien, ordained
deacon of the church in Constantinople by Chrysostom. The exterior of
St. Victor resembles a badly-built small fort surrounded by 7 unequal
and uncouth square towers, the two largest at the N. side having been
added by Pope Urban&nbsp;V., a&nbsp;former abbot of the monastery. Over
the entrance door under these towers is a rude representation of St.
George and the dragon. The upper church dates only from the beginning of
the 13th cent. Near the sacristy in the S. side a stair of 32 steps
leads down to the original church, a&nbsp;large and spacious crypt. Of
this crypt the most ancient part is the small chapel shut off from the
rest, with several tombs hewn in the rock. Among those buried here were
St. Victor, and, according to the tradition of the place, Lazarus also,
who is said to have died at Marseilles. The ancient appearance of this
chapel is marred by a modern altar with a stone reredos, sculptured, it
is said, by Puget. The shaft of one of the columns has a sculptured rope
coiled round it. Pieces of ornamental sculpture are seen at different
parts of the crypt, and remnants of a fresco painting. This also is the
sanctuary of a miraculous wooden image of Mary and Child, said to have
been carved by Luke. It is of a dark colour, is 3½ ft. high, and is
called Notre Dame de Confession, whose intercession is sought by crowds
of votaries from the 2d till the 9th of February. The best of the
sarcophagi have been removed to the museum in the <a href =
"#marseilles_borely">Château Borély</a> (p.&nbsp;113). At the foot of
the eminence on which the church stands are Fort St. Nicolas and the
Bassin de Carénage, whence a sou ferry steamboat crosses every four
minutes to the other side. Among the modern churches perhaps the best is
Saint Vincent de Paul, built in the style of the 13th cent.</p>

with its old château built by Francis&nbsp;I., long used as a state
prison. Boats for the excursion lie at the Cannebière end of the Port.
They charge from 5 to 9&nbsp;frs.; but it is necessary to arrange the
price before starting. The landing-place is at some low shelving rocks,
whence a stair ascends to the terrace, on which are, to the right the
entrance to the Château, and a little to the left a restaurant.
A&nbsp;man conducts visitors over the castle, of which the most
interesting parts are the cell of Monte Christo, and the place where he
was thrown over into the sea.</p>

Berre, and on the islets within this outlet, all connected by bridges.
The railway station, the hotel, and a large part of the town are on the
E. or Jonquière side. On the first or smallest of the 3 islets are the
Tribunal de la Pèche and the fish-market; on the middle one is the Hôtel
de Ville; and on the third and largest are the hospital and the parish
church with sculptured portals. On the N. side of the canal is the part
of the town called Ferrières, containing the harbour and the reservoirs
for the manufacture of salt. Fishing is the principal industry of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>There are in Marseilles numerous charitable institutions. The
infirmary (Hôtel Dieu), founded in 1188 and rebuilt in 1593, can
accommodate 750 patients. The workhouse (Hospice de la Charité) contains
generally from 600 to 680 orphan children and aged men and women. Near
the Prado is the Hôpital de la Concepcion, with 800 beds.</p>

<p>The leading industry is soap-making, which occupies sixty factories,
with 1200 artisans, and produces annually 65,000 tons, valued at
£2,000,000 sterling. With this manufacture are connected oil and
chemical works; in the former, which employ 2000 to 2500 workmen, 55,000
tons of different oils are produced yearly. The chemical works employ
2000 operatives in the manufacture of the salts of soda and concentrated
acids, the value of whose annual production may be estimated at
£320,000. Metallurgy is another great industry; a&nbsp;large quantity of
ore, imported from Elba, Spain, and Algeria, is smelted in the blast
furnaces of St. Louis in the suburbs. The Mediterranean ironworks and
yards, together with other private companies, have large workshops for
the construction or repair of marine steam-engines, and for every branch
of iron shipbuilding, employing several thousand workmen. Marseilles is
a great centre for the extraction of silver from

invaders it was repeopled in the 10th century under the protection of
its viscounts. In 1112 the town bought up their rights, and was formed
into a republic, governed by a podestat, appointed for life. In the
remainder of the Middle Ages, however, this arrangement was modified,
the higher town was governed by the bishop, and had its harbour at the
creek of La Joliette. The southern suburb was governed by the abbot of
St. Victor, and owned the Port des Catalans. The republic or lower town,
situated between the two, retained the old harbour, and was the most
powerful of the three divisions. The period of the Crusades brought
great prosperity to Marseilles. King René made it his winter residence.
Louis XIV. came in person to Marseilles to quell the disturbances under
the Fronde. He took the town by storm, and had Fort St. Nicolas
constructed. Marseilles repeatedly suffered from the plague, and an
epidemic raged from May 1720 to May 1721 with a severity for which it is
almost impossible to find a parallel; Bishop Belsunce, Chevalier Rose,
and others immortalised themselves by their courage and devotion.</p>

<p>During the Revolution of 1793 the people rose against the
aristocracy, who up to that time had governed the commune. In the Terror
they rebelled against the Convention, but were promptly subdued by
General Carteux. The wars of the empire, by dealing a severe blow to
their maritime commerce, excited the hatred of the inhabitants against
Napoleon. Since 1815 the prosperity of the city has received a
considerable impulse from the conquest of Algeria and the opening of the
Suez Canal.</p>

the 10th May 1760, and died (it is said in poverty) at Choisy-le-Roi,
6¼&nbsp;m. S. from Paris by rail, on the 27th June 1836. On the 24th
April 1792, the day before the departure of a detachment of volunteers,
Dietrich, the Mayor of Strasburg, gave a banquet to their officers, and
during dinner requested Rouget, then an officer in the engineers, to
compose a war-song for them. Although it was late before Rouget retired
to his room, he had both the music and the words ready before going to
bed. In the morning he handed the paper to his host, saying: “<i>Tenez,
voilá ce que vous m’avez demandé, mais j’ai peur que cela ne soit pas
trop bon.</i>” “<i>Que dites vous mon ami?</i>” said Dietrich, after
casting his eye over the MS.; “<i>vous avez fait un chef-d’œuvre.</i>”
The mayor’s wife having tried it on the piano, the orchestra of the
theatre were engaged to perform it in the principal square of Strasburg,
when such was the enthusiasm it created that the detachment marched off
with nearly 1000 instead of 600 volunteers. For them Rouget called the
air “Le Chant de guerre de l’armée du Rhin.” In July of the same year a
detachment of volunteers was sent to Paris from Marseilles by order of
Barbaroux, and as they were in the habit of singing this song both on
their march and in the capital it received the name of the “Hymne des
Marseillais.” Charles Barbaroux, born at Marseilles in 1767, died on the
scaffold June 1794, was one of the deputies who contributed most to the
fall of the monarchy. He belonged to the party called the Girondins.</p>

<b>MARSEILLES.</b> See under “Marseilles, Toulon, Nice et Menton” in the
“Indicateur.” The train, after leaving Marseilles on its way to Toulon,
traverses beautiful fertile valleys opening to the sea, and bounded by
mountains mostly with whitish calcareous tops. Having crossed the stream
Huveaune and traversed several tunnels and the Durance and Marseilles
canal, the slow trains halt at the villages of St. Marcel, with the
chapel of N.&nbsp;D. de Nazareth, and St. Menet, and La Penne, all
situated at the foot of Mont Carpiagne. During the season, from May to
October, a&nbsp;coach at the St. Menet station awaits passengers for the
cold mineral baths of Camoins, 2&nbsp;m. distant, or 5&nbsp;m. by
omnibus from Marseilles. The bathing establishment is about ¼&nbsp;m.
from the village, in an undulating hollow, among plane trees, olives,
and vines. The water is cold, and contains iron and iodine, with a great
deal of sulphur. It is very effective as a tonic, and in diseases of the
liver. The establishment is quiet but comfortable. Pension 8 to
9&nbsp;frs. per day.</p>

<p>10½ m. from Marseilles is <a name = "aubagne" id =
"aubagne"><b>Aubagne</b></a>, pop. 8100. H.&nbsp;Notre Dame. Omnibus
daily to Marseilles, stopping at H.&nbsp;St. Louis. Every train halts at
Aubagne. Junction with loop-line to Valdonne, 10½&nbsp;m. N., with
coal-mines and potteries. Coach from Valdonne to Aix by Fuveau, where
take rail.</p>

<p>After Aubagne the train passes through the tunnel of Mussaguet, and,
if a slow train, halts at the next station, Cassis, a&nbsp;pleasant
fishing village in an oasis at the head of a small bay, between Mont
Gardiole (to the west), culminating point 1800 ft., and Mont de Canaille
(to the east), culminating point 1365 ft. <i>Inn:</i> Hotel and Pension
Liautaud. An omnibus awaits passengers at the station, 30 cents.
A&nbsp;very pretty path, passing by the Grotte de Regagne and through a
forest of pines on the sides of Mont Canaille, leads to La Ciotat,
6½&nbsp;m. east by this road, and 23&nbsp;m. from Marseilles by rail.
The station for La Ciotat is 2½&nbsp;m. from the town, but an omnibus
awaits passengers. <i>Inn:</i> H.&nbsp;de l’Univers, at the head of a
well-protected harbour, nearly encircled by two strong stone jetties. At
the western side of the little bay is a curious promontory, the Bec de
l’Aigle (well seen from the station), composed of three lofty rocks in a
row, perpendicular on the W. side. Beyond the point is the

on in <a name = "la_ciotat" id = "la_ciotat"><b>La Ciotat</b></a>; but
the main business of the place is derived from the great shipbuilding
yards of the Messageries Maritimes, which may be said to employ directly
and indirectly the whole town.</p>

<p>4¼ m. beyond La Ciotat, or 27¼ from Marseilles, is the pretty village
of St. Cyr, close to the station. 4¼&nbsp;m. farther is the station for
Bandol, a&nbsp;fishing village at the head of a shallow bay with small
islands. The industries are cooperage and the culture of immortelles in
fields on the plain and on terraces on the sides of the hills.</p>

<p>36 m. E. from Marseilles is the station Ollioules-St.-Nazaire, where
omnibuses await passengers for St. Nazaire, pop. 2500, a&nbsp;port on
the Mediterranean, and for Ollioules, pop. 3900, <i>Inn:</i> Trotobas;
situated a short way inland on the Reppe, in a deep hollow surrounded by
limestone cliffs, which, about 2&nbsp;m. up the river, are so close to
each other as to form a gloomy ravine, at one time the haunt of the
brigand Gaspard de Besse. The great industry of Ollioules, Nazaire, and
Bandol is the culture of immortelles, which, when made up into wreaths,
are sent all over France. The largest and best cost 24 frs. the dozen.
Yellow is the natural colour of the flower, but they are variously dyed
or bleached. They are cultivated on terraces among olive trees. Oranges
and lemons grow freely here. The coach for Beausset halts in the Place
of Ollioules, and then runs up the right bank of the Reppe to Beausset,
pop. 3000. <i>Inn:</i> France.</p>

constant communication by steamers. Near the hotel is the office of the
omnibus for Tamaris, a&nbsp;village 1¼&nbsp;m. S.E., at the foot of Fort
Napoleon, and on the Rade (roads) du Lazaret. The omnibus returns by
Balaguier. The Toulon omnibus for Reynier passes through La Seyne, from
which Reynier is 3&nbsp;m. W. On the hill above Reynier are the new fort
and what remains of the ancient village of <a name = "six_fours" id =

cent., is at the entrance extending east and west, and was originally
the whole building. To the right hand are two stone altars (6th cent.),
with windows behind them to give light to the officiating priest, who at

follow the Government docks of Vauban, Castigneau, and Missiessy, all
communicating with each other by swing bridges, and surrounded by
well-built quays. The most conspicuous features of Toulon are the
<a name = "toulon_arsenal" id = "toulon_arsenal">arsenals</a> and the
establishments connected with them, which are on a scale of almost
unrivalled magnificence, occupying 717 acres, and employing above 10,000
men. Near the west end of the Port a large gateway with marble columns
forms the entrance into the “Arsenal Maritime,” covering 240 acres, and
containing a general storehouse, 100 forge fires, two covered
building-slips, a&nbsp;ropery 1050 feet long, and an armoury with at the
entrance two caryatides and a colossal eagle by Puget. Adjoining is the
Arsenal de Castigneau, constructed on piles along the bay towards La
Seyne, with the bakery, ironworks, and ship-equipment departments.</p>

<p>Although Toulon, rather a dirty town, is crowded with marines and
sailors, it maintains by the constant influx of the peasantry all the
characteristics of a town of Provence. Theatres of every grade abound,
from the Grand Opera House down to the poor little café chantant, where
gaudily-dressed females electrify the audience with popular ballads. The
most pleasant lounge in winter is on the Quai du Port, as the wharf
fronting the town-dock is called. As long as

the sun is above the horizon it shines there, consequently during the
cold season it is crowded with all kinds of people, most of whom,
unfortunately, are poisoning the air with execrable tobacco. On it are
good cafés and restaurants, and booksellers’ shops where plans of the
town and neighbourhood are sold. This now gay sunny promenade was in
November 1793 the scene of one of the most horrid butcheries of human
life recorded in history, when the infuriated Republican soldiers, mad
with vengeance, slaughtered above 6000 of their countrymen, not sparing
even those of their own party, in their blind rage. Sir Sydney Smith,
amidst the flames of burning ships and dockyards, and the shrieks and
imploring cries of the terrified populace, succeeded in rescuing and
embarking some 1500. Napoleon, then a lad of 23, by whose military
genius the discomfiture of the English had been effected, exerted
himself to the utmost, but in vain, to stay the carnage.</p>

Toulon: Town Hall.</span></p>

<p>Among the houses which border the Quai du Port is the <a name =
"toulon_town_hall" id = "toulon_town_hall"><b>Town Hall</b></a>, adorned
with two admirable caryatides by Pierre Puget. In front is the statue
representing Navigation, and at No. 64 of the street behind is the
corner house Puget built for himself. It contains four stories of nearly
square windows, those in the lowest and highest rows being the smallest.
The small side has three windows in each row, and the large four, the
windows of the first three rows over the doorway being in couples. On
the angles are shallow grooved foliated pilasters, and under the eaves a
projecting dentil cornice.</p>

<p>The most sheltered street in winter, and the coolest in summer, is
the Rue Lafayette, a&nbsp;broad avenue lined with shops and shaded with
immense lime trees. It commences at the east end of the Port and bends
round to the Place Puget. About half of the street is occupied by a
fruit, flower, and vegetable market. In the second story of the narrow
five-storied house, at No. 89 (the Port end), is one of the cannon-balls
fired by the English during the struggle of November 1793. (See above.)
At the Port end of the street is the “Place,” whence the omnibus starts
for Mourillon; also the church of St. François de Paule. The interior
contains pictures and statues of some merit. The reredos of the altar to
the left represents one of the interviews between J.&nbsp;C. and
Marguerite Alacoque, while that of the altar to the right represents
Mary announcing herself to the girl swineherd at Lourdes to be the
“conceived without sin.”</p>

The exterior is unattractive. The interior is better. The organ-loft
over the entrance is of carved oak. The alabaster reredos of the altar
in the chapel to the right of the high altar is by the sculptor Veyrier.
The tabernacle and the two angels under it are by Puget, who is said to
have executed also the alto-relievo on the side wall of the chapel
representing the apostles looking into the empty tomb of Mary. Over the
arch of the chapel on the left of the high altar is a Madonna in wood by
Canova. Several very good pictures adorn the church.</p>

<p>All the steamers sail from the Quai du Port. The best and largest are
those which cross to <a href = "#la_seyne">La Seyne</a> (p.&nbsp;123).
The steamers for the Iles d’Hyères and for St. Mandrier sail also from
this wharf. The St. Mandrier steamer makes the trip six times daily,
calling first at Balaguier, where the landing-place is between Fort
Aiguillette to the north and Fort Balaguier to the south, the latter
being easily recognised by its round tower. The restaurant and houses
are situated towards Fort Aiguillette. On the other side of the point of
Fort Balaguier is Le Tamarin, or Tamaris, consisting chiefly of pretty
villas in luxuriant gardens full of palms and orange trees. Behind
Tamaris rises Fort Napoleon, commanding a splendid view. An excellent
carriage-road leads up to the top. It commences near the neck of land of
the peninsula of Cepet. An omnibus runs between Le Tamaris, Balaguier,
and La Seyne. 
<span class = "headnote float">

The steamer, after touching at Balaguier, crosses the roads or Rade du
Lazaret and enters the small bay of <a name = "st_mandrier" id =
"st_mandrier"><b>St. Mandrier</b></a>. At the landing-place is a
comfortable inn, charging 8 to 10 frs. per day. Round the point, in a
warm nook among the hills, is the hospital of St. Mandrier, with 1200
beds, one of the most important establishments of this kind in France.
It occupies three sides of a parallelogram, has a handsome chapel, and a
great cistern vaulted with concentric circles. Adjoining is a large and
well-sheltered garden with orange trees. Visitors are readily admitted.
In Toulon, near the Place d’Armes, is the Hôpital de la Marine,
exclusively for the navy. Although well ordered, it is hardly
sufficiently ventilated.</p>

town by the Port of Ste. Anne&mdash;the name is on the gateway. From

and to the top. The nearly level road to the right goes to Fort Faron,
and the steep road to the left to Fort de la Croix on a rock above Fort
Faron. Both are on the east or the La Valette side of the mountain. The
summit consists of a stony tableland, from which rise knolls of various

Patmos, is said to have been done by Puget. From this village the ascent
is made of <a name = "mont_coudon" id = "mont_coudon"><b>Mt.

graceful yet bold indentured coast of France as exhibited from Coudon.”
&mdash;<i>George Sand.</i> A carriage-road leads up to the very top, but
unfortunately, when only a few feet from the summit, farther progress is
stopped by a fort, and the best of the view lost. Commence the ascent
from the narrow lane opposite the Hôtel de Ville, and, once on the high
road, never leave it. On the way up many very beautiful land and sea
views disclose themselves.</p>

hills and garden-walls. Cap Brun and Ste. Marguerite are both forts on
cliffs projecting into the sea. To the east of the Fort Ste. Marguerite
is the village, consisting of a few houses, with a small chapel among
villas and cottages scattered over the slope of an eminence rising from
a tiny cove. Le Pradet is a considerable village a little to the S. of

Hyères can await its arrival. The coach to Brignoles passes by the same
way, but at an earlier hour. From Solliès-Pont commences the beautiful
part of the route, up the fertile valley of the Gapeau between lofty and
precipitous calcareous mountains. The slopes are covered with large
olive trees, and the plain with fields and vineyards and numerous cherry

from the head monastery of the order, the Chartreuse of Grenoble. The
Carthusians and Trappists resemble each other in dress and in their
rules, the chief difference being that the Trappists sleep in the same

the Iles d’Or. These three are first-class houses, and charge per day
from 15 to 20 frs., including bedroom, service, wine, candles, and three
meals with coffee or tea in the morning. Next the Iles d’Or is the
Hesperides, 8 to 12 frs. Off the main street are the Ambassadeurs and
the Europe, both from 10 to 12 frs., frequented chiefly by those who
come only for a few days. At the east end of Boulevard des Palmiers the
H.&nbsp;du Parc, 12 to 15 frs. On opposite side, and well situated for
the sun, is the second-class house, the H.&nbsp;Iles d’Hyères, 7 to 10

The principal hotel on the east side of Hyères is the H.&nbsp;Orient, 10
to 13 frs., a&nbsp;comfortable and old-established house, opposite the
public gardens. Farther east, and off the high road to St. Tropez, is
the Beau-Séjour, from 12 to 15 frs. Down by one of the roads to the sea

is near the sea, in a forest of pines and cork oaks, it combines the
advantages of Arcachon with those of Hyères. All the above prices
include tea or coffee in the morning, and meat breakfast and dinner,
with wine to both. Abundance of furnished apartments and villas to let.
In the Place des Palmiers are a French and an English bank. Both

Vallée de Borel, in the heart of the Maure mountains. This road passes
by the large farmhouse of Ste. Eulalie, in a plain full of large olive
trees, some 6&nbsp;feet in diameter. There are also some large pines.
Besides these excursions there are a great many little drives which may

<p><b>Hyères proper</b> is a little dirty town of narrow streets,
running up the south-east side of the castle hill; like, however, all
the other winter stations, the new quarter, with its handsome streets
and villas, has far outgrown the original limits. A&nbsp;plain,
2&nbsp;m. wide, is between the town and the sea. The beautifully-wooded
Maure mountains surround it on the land side, mitigating the keenness of
the north, north-east, and east winds, but affording indifferent
protection from the mistral or north-west wind. The Toulon road,
extending east and west, forms the principal thoroughfare. On it, and in
its proximity, are the best shops and the best hotels. From it rise the
steep streets of the old town, of which two of the gateways still exist.
At the east end, fronting the Place de la Rade, is the Porte des Salins,
and at the west end the Porte Fenouillet. Exactly half-way between these
two stood the principal gateway, the Porte Portalet, from which the
street R.&nbsp;Portalet leads directly up to the *Place Massillon,
containing the fish-market, a&nbsp;bust of Massillon, and the Maison des
Templiers, 12th cent., now the Hôtel de Ville.
<span class = "headnote float"><a name = "massillon" id = "massillon">
Massillon.</a></span>
Standing with the face towards the Hôtel de Ville, we have to the left a
dirty narrow street called the Rue Rubaton, in which is the house, No.
7, where Massillon, the greatest of the pulpit orators of France, was
born on the 24th of June 1663. In the pulpit he appeared sedate, without
gesture and parade. On one occasion, when he preached to the Court at
Versailles, his sermon produced such a powerful effect on Louis XIV.
that he exclaimed in the presence of the Court&mdash; “Father,
I&nbsp;have heard several good orators and have been satisfied with
them, but whenever I hear you I am dissatisfied with myself.” The
language of Massillon, though noble, was simple, and always natural and
just, without labour and affectation. When he preached for the first
time in the church of St. Eustache in Paris his famous sermon on Matthew
vii. 14, and had arrived at the peroration, the entire congregation rose
from their seats, transported and dismayed. This prosopopœia, which
still astonishes in the perusal, has been chosen by Voltaire in the
article “Eloquence” in the <i>Encyclopédie</i> as an example presenting
“<i>la figure la plus hardie, et l’un des plus beaux traits d’éloquence
qu’on puisse lire chez les anciens et les modernes</i>.” His father, who
spelt his name Masseilhon, was a notary. The business was continued from
father to son in the same house from 1647 to 1834.</p>

<p>At the low part of the town, in the Place Royale or de la République,
is the church of <a name = "hyeres_st_louis" id =
"hyeres_st_louis"><b>St. Louis</b></a>, built in the 12th cent. in the
Byzantine style and restored in 1840. The floor is 11 steps below the
entrance. The quadripartite vault is supported on lofty wide-spanned
arches. The pulpit, of walnut, is beautifully carved. The 19 stalls
display elegance and originality of design in the form and arrangement
of the canopies. The confessionals are also tastefully carved, and are
set into the wall. Behind the altar, to the right, is a large and
remarkable picture representing the landing of St. Louis with his queen
and their 3 children on the beach of Hyères (the Plage du Ceinturon) on
the 12th of July 1254, when the royal family were the guests of Bertrand
de Foz in the castle. The other picture, which is modern, represents St.
Louis about to enter Notre Dame of Paris. The statue over the fountain
in this square, the Place de la République, represents Charles of Anjou
and Provence, 9th son of Louis VIII. of France, and brother of Louis IX.
In 1245 Charles married the great heiress the Countess Beatrice, which
event closed the independent political life of Provence by uniting it to
the house of Anjou. In 1257, on the principle that might is right, he
dispossessed Count Foz of the castle and territory of Hyères. At the
western end of the town is the Place des Palmiers, with palms planted in
1836. Those which adorn the Boulevard des Palmiers were planted in 1864,
and came from Spain. Napoleon&nbsp;I. lodged in the house No. 7 of the
Place des Palmiers after the siege of Toulon. Around Hyères are numerous
nursery-gardens, and on the plain, down by the Avenue de la Gare, is the
“Jardin d’Acclimatation,” where animals, birds, and plants are reared
for the Jardin d’Acclimatation of Paris, of which it is a branch. These
gardens form a most enjoyable and amusing retreat, are well sheltered,
and plants, flowers, and milk are sold in them. Open to the public.</p>

of acquiring a topographical knowledge of the environs. Ascend by the
Hôtel de Ville and the steep narrow streets beyond, keeping to the
right, as the entrance into the castle-grounds is at the S.E. end of the
wall. The castle, 657 ft. above the sea, is believed to have been
founded in the 7th cent., although not mentioned till the 10th, when it
is called <i>Castrum aræarum</i> or <i>aræis</i>, “air-castle.”
Considerable portions of the walls, and some of the towers and dungeons,
still remain, the most perfect part being on the western side, above the
Hôtel des Iles d’Or. The view from the ramparts is beautiful.
Immediately beneath are the town and its dependencies, like a map in
bold relief. Southwards, towards the sea, is the great plain, studded
with farmhouses, cypresses, olive plantations, and vegetable gardens.
Beyond is the roadstead, with generally one or more vessels of war
moored off the village of Les Vieux Salins. Out at sea, to the east, are
the islands of Levant, Port-Cros, and Bagaud, the smallest of the three.
Farther west, towards the peninsula of Giens, is <a href =
"#porquerolles">Porquerolles</a> (p.&nbsp;131), the largest of the
islands. Giens is distinctly seen, with its two necks of land 3&nbsp;m.
long. On the land side from Giens the view is bounded to the west by the
little hermitage hill bearing the chapel of N.&nbsp;D. d’Hyères, and the
Oiseaux mountains, on whose sunny flanks is Costebelle. North from
Oiseaux peak is Mt. Paradis, 982 ft., which looks as if the top had been
shaved off. Northwards from Mt. Paradis, on the other side of the plain,
are <a href = "#mont_coudon_2">Mt. Coudon</a>, 2305 ft. (see
p.&nbsp;125), and the eastern extremity of Mt. Faron, behind Toulon.
Towards the east the view is bounded by the Maure mountains and the
Pointe de la Galère, with Fort Brégançon. From this fort, northwards by
the beach, are the châteaux of Brégançon and Léoubes. The highest peak
of the Maures is 2556 ft. above the sea, crowned by the chapel of Notre
Dame des Anges. (Refer to maps, <a href = "#map123">pp. 123</a> and

<p>Behind Hyères Castle is the highest of the ridges in the Maurette

western extremity. The path to it, which skirts the whole ridge,
commences at the back of the castle, just under the peak of La Potence,
633 ft., on which is a fragment of a tower. A&nbsp;gibbet for the
execution of malefactors stood there, hence the name. The small hill
above the east end of Hyères, and standing between the old and new
cemeteries, is a favourite walk, and commands a good view. Before
descending from the castle observe the road to Mt. Fenouillet.</p>

the Maurettes by the Potence to Mt. Decugis, 585 ft. The path to the
left, called the “Chemin St. Bernard,” leads down to the west end of
Hyères, near the octroi office and the hospital. The centre path leads
to Mt. Fenouillet through plantations of olives, cork oaks, and firs,
and some fine brushwood, of which the most beautiful in winter is the
<i>Arbutus unedo</i>, or strawberry tree. When less than half-way a road
at Mt. Roustan, 608 ft., diverges N.E. by a ridge projecting into the
valley of the Gapeau. Just under the peak of Fenouillet is a small
chapel visited by pilgrims. From the summit, at the foot of the cross
(3&nbsp;Mai 1877), there is a superb and extensive view. Numerous paths
lead from it down to the road between Hyères and Toulon.</p>

<p><a name = "hyeres_oiseaux" id = "hyeres_oiseaux"><b>Excursion to the

is nearly concealed by brushwood, especially by the <i>Quercus
coccifera</i>. The trees on the summit, 982 ft., obstruct the view, but
on the way up charming landscapes now and then unfold themselves of
Hyères on one side and of Carqueyranne on the other.</p>

<p><a name = "trou_fees" id = "trou_fees"><b>The Trou des

side of the Oiseaux peak, is a cave called the Trou des Fées. The
entrance is by a vertical cavity, resembling a well. The interior,
covered with stalactites, is about 96 ft. long by 40 wide. To explore it
lights are necessary. The hole is not very easy to find, though a path
leads directly to it. It is situated under some fir trees. The road down
by the eastern valley of the Montagnes des Oiseaux to the Costebelle
road passes near one of the principal springs which supply the town. The
other source is in the plain, on the road “du Père-Eternel,” nearly
2&nbsp;m. S.E. from the town. It is pumped up by an engine of 26
horse-power. This water filters to this place from the Gapeau, 1&nbsp;m.
E., through the gravelly soil of the plain.</p>

<p>To mention all the drives and walks would be both difficult and
confusing. As all the roads and paths are free, the tourist may ramble
in whatever direction he pleases, either through the orchards or up the
lonely but beautifully-wooded valleys and mountains. The only sound
heard is the occasional report of a gun, fired by the “chasseurs” at
such game as blackbirds, thrushes, jays, bullfinches, and larks. In the
swamps about Giens are occasionally snipes and wild ducks. The Maure
mountains and their interminable valleys offer ample scope for the
walking powers of the most indefatigable pedestrian.</p>

Cork-cutting.</span></p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The principal agricultural products of Hyères, as indeed of all the
Riviera, are olives, wine, and cork. The olive-berry harvest commences
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139" id = "page139"> </a>

in December. The small berries make the best oil. The trunk has a
curious propensity to separate and form new limbs, which by degrees
become covered with bark. If the sap be still in a semi-dormant state,
and the weather dry, the trunk and branches can bear a cold of 12°
Fahr., while the orange and lemon are killed by a cold of 22°. The cold
of 1820 killed the orange trees about Hyères, and nearly all the trunks
and branches of the olive trees, but not the roots; from each of which
sprang, in the course of time, two or three saplings, now trees growing
round one common centre. Next to the Aleppo, maritime and umbrella
pines, the most numerous of the forest trees is the cork oak, or <a name
= "hyeres_cork" id = "hyeres_cork"><i>Quercus suber</i></a>, generally
accompanied with the diminutive member of the oak tribe, the <i>Quercus
coccifera</i>. The bark forms an important article of commerce. When the
stem of the young cork oak has become 4 inches in diameter, the bark is
removed for the first time, but it is of no use. Ten or even fifteen
years afterwards, when the bark is about an inch thick, the trunk is
stripped again, by making two circular incisions 3 to 4&nbsp;feet apart,
and two vertical on opposite sides. This operation is repeated every
tenth year in the month of June, when the sap is in full vigour.
A&nbsp;cork tree does not produce fine-grained cork till it is fifty
years old. Cork-cutting, which formed an important industry in the
mountain villages, is gradually leaving them and settling in the towns
on the railways, on account of the greater facility of transport.

Processional Caterpillar.<br>

The curious caterpillar of the Moth, <i>Bombyx processionaria</i>, feeds
on the leaves of the Aleppo and maritime pine trees. Their nests, made
of a cobweb material, and shaped like a soda-water bottle, are firmly
attached to the branches. On cutting them open the caterpillars are
found coiled up in a ball, and do not endeavour to escape. They feed
during the night. When they leave the nest they go in procession,
following each other with great precision. On the summits of the Maures,
and on all the mountains bordering the Riviera, grows the heath <i>Erica
arborea</i>, from whose roots <a name = "hyeres_pipes" id =
"hyeres_pipes">pipes</a> are made. The digging up and the preparing of
these roots for the Paris manufacturers form now an important industry
in the mountain villages. In England they are called briar-root pipes,
briar being a corruption of the French word <i>bruyère</i>, signifying
heath.</p>

The “specialité” of Hyères is the rearing of early vegetables, fruits,
and flowers, for the northern markets, especially roses, strawberries,
peaches, apricots, artichokes, and peas. The broad flat alluvial plain
between the town and the sea is admirably suited for this purpose. The
gardens are easily irrigated, and besides, within a few feet of the

it is the nearest, the cheapest, and the most rural. For such as require
gaiety, Hyères is not suited. “The chief attractions of Hyères are its
climate and the beauty of its environs, which render it an agreeable
place, of winter abode, even for persons in health, who do not require
the animated movement and recreative resources presented by large towns,
and who are in tolerable walking condition; the walks and rides, both on
the plain and through the cork-tree woods, by which the hills are for
the most part covered, presenting considerable variety, while from the
more elevated positions charming prospects may be enjoyed.”
&mdash;<i>Dr. Edwin Lee.</i> The mean winter temperature is 47°.4 F.,
and the average annual rainfall is 26 inches. But on the Riviera, as in
England, every winter varies in the rainfall and in the degree of cold;
and therefore the chances are that the traveller’s experience will not
agree with the carefully-compiled stereotyped meteorological tables. The
climate of Hyères is less stimulating and exciting than at Cannes and
Nice; and, “generally, it may be said to be fitted for children or young
persons of a lymphatic temperament, or of a scrofulous diathesis, either
predisposed to consumption, or suffering from the first stage of that
disease.”</p>

8¾ m. S. from La Pauline, and 2½ m. S. from Hyères, is the station for
<a name = "la_plage" id = "la_plage">La Plage</a>, consisting of some
pretty villas built between the beach and a wood of umbrella pines. From
the pier the <i>Zephyr</i> sails every afternoon (excepting Sunday) to
<a href = "#porquerolles">Porquerolles</a> (p.&nbsp;131). The beach
adjoining the E. side is Le Ceinturon, where St. Louis landed in 1254.
At La Plage station commences the larger of the two necks of land which
connect the peninsula of Giens, 3¼&nbsp;m. S., with the mainland. The
large neck is traversed by a line of rails extending nearly to the Tour
Fondue, whence a boat sails to Porquerolles, the town opposite
(p.&nbsp;131). The road along the neck, which at some parts is very hot
and sandy, skirts <a name = "giens_saltworks" id =

end of the marshes is the little village of the saltmakers. The salt is
heaped up in pyramid-shaped piles, covered on the top with tiles, and on
the sides with boards, which gives them the appearance of houses. Very
fine views both of Giens and Hyères are obtained on the way to the
saltworks. The easiest way to approach the narrow neck is by the
Carqueyranne coach. It leads directly to the village of <a name =
"le_chateau" id = "le_chateau"><b>Le Château</b></a>, with a neat church
and the ruins of a castle. Many rare plants and immense quantities of
uni- and bivalve shells are found at Giens, especially on the smaller of
the two necks.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
From Le Château a road leads westward to the small fishing hamlet of La
Madrague, passing on the left a huge block of quartz with layers of
mica. From a little beyond La Madrague take the road leading up to a
house with a pepper-box turret, whence the continuation leads up to the
semaphore or signal-station, on the highest point of the isthmus, 407
ft. above the sea. The hills are well wooded, and the tiny valleys
covered with orchards, vineyards, and fields. Many pleasant rambles can
be had on the isthmus.</p>

Salins stops at the small “Place” opposite the pier. Fare, ½ fr. It
traverses a road bordered by mulberry trees, between vineyards and olive
groves. Les Salins is a poor hamlet with a little harbour frequented by
feluccas and the boats of the training ships anchored in the bay. Behind
the hamlet are immense shallow reservoirs for the evaporation of
sea-water principally in July and August. These reservoirs or Salins
occupy above 1000 acres, and produce annually 20,000 tons of the value
of £10,000. It is very coarse grained, but is much esteemed by the
fish-curers. 60 workmen are employed permanently, but during the hot or

<b>Coach to Carqueyranne</b>, 6¼ m. W., by Costebelle and the coast.
After having rounded the base of Hermitage Hill the coach arrives at the
commencement of the small neck of land where passengers for the
peninsula of Giens alight. Scarcely 200 yards beyond this are the almost
buried ruins of the Roman naval station of <a name = "pomponiana" id =
"pomponiana"><b>Pomponiana</b></a>, some fine olive trees, and several
villas. A&nbsp;road from this leads to the Hermitage, passing an
olive-oil mill. West from Pomponiana by the high road is Carqueyranne,
a&nbsp;small straggling village, from which the little port is about
½&nbsp;m. distant by nearly a straight road southwards. The Toulon
omnibus from the Place d’Italie halts at the port, but passes through
the village on its way to Toulon. The peak to the west of Carqueyranne
is Mt. Negre, 985 ft., and to the east are the peaks Oiseaux, 982 ft.,
and Paradis, 980 ft. Mt. Paradis may be conveniently ascended from
Carqueyranne, commencing from the valley between the two chains. In
Carqueyranne are produced the earliest strawberries, peas, potatoes, and
artichokes for the Paris market. It is 3½° warmer than Hyères.</p>

Salins, halts a few minutes at La Londe, 7¾&nbsp;m. E., a&nbsp;little
village with an inn, situated on both sides of the St. Tropez road.
Shortly afterwards the Bormes and Lavandou road separates from the St.
Tropez road, and extends S. through a wood of fir and cork trees. Bormes
is picturesquely situated among a group of hills to the east of that
long ridge which terminates with Cape Benat and the Fort Brégançon. In
the Place de la République or St. François is the inn, commanding a good
view from the back windows. At the east end of the inn is the old
churchyard, and a little beyond the new cemetery on the road to
Collobrières, 14&nbsp;m. N. On the other side of the “Place” is the
parish church, from which a path leads up to the ruins of the castle,
12th cent., built by the Seigneurs of Bormes. Latterly it was occupied
by monks. From the castle a path, passing six small chapels, ascends to
the church of Notre Dame, commanding, especially from the portico,
a&nbsp;pretty view of the plains, sea, and mountains, as far as Toulon.
Bormes suffers from want of water. Less than an hour’s easy walking from
Bormes is Lavandou, a&nbsp;prosperous fishing village on the coast road
from Brégançon to St. Tropez. Savoury “langousts” or rock-lobsters are

this ancient town was commenced by Charles&nbsp;II. of Sicily towards
the end of the 13th cent, over the underground chapel of St. Maximin,
1st cent. It has no transept. The nave is 239½ ft. long and 91½ ft.
high, and the aisles on each side 211 ft. long and 58 ft. high. The
width of the church is 127½ feet. The exterior is ugly and unfinished.
The interior of the roof rests on triple vaulting shafts rising from 10
piers on each side of the nave. Above the western entrance is a large
and fine-toned organ, which was saved from destruction by the organist
Fourcade playing upon it the Marseillaise. The case, the pulpit, and the
lovely screen of the sanctuary are of walnut wood from the forest of
Ste. Baume. Few parts of any church present such an admirable
combination of beauty, elegance, and symmetry as this sanctuary, by a
Flemish monk, Frère Louis, in 1692. Round the screen are 20 sculptured
panels, each bearing within a wreath a representation in relief of one
of the incidents in the life of some celebrated member of the order of
St. Dominic. Under them are 92 stalls in 4 rows; at one end is the
rood-loft, and at the other the high altar against the apsidal wall. The
entrance is by one door on each side, adorned with chaste sculpture and
spiral colonnettes. To the left, or N. of the altar, is a relief by
Puget (?) in marble, representing the Ascension of Mary Magdalene, and
on the other side, in terra-cotta, Mary receiving the Communion from St.
Maximin down in the crypt where she died. The reredos of the altar at
the east end of the N. aisle consists of a painting on wood by an
Italian artist in 1520. In the centre is a large Crucifixion, and on
each side 8 paintings on panels representing the Passion. Below, on the
table of the altar, is an Entombment. In the second chapel from this is
another reredos in the same style, representing St. Laurent, St.
Anthony, St. Sebastian, and St. Aquinius. Here, in a small window-like
recess, is a very ancient iron Crucifixion. From the chapel behind the
pulpit is the entrance into the cloister and convent, 13th and 14th

cents. The sculpture above the sound-board of the pulpit is of one
piece, and represents the Ascension of Mary Magdalene. The undulating
fluting on the panels and the sculpture on the railing are very
graceful. Behind is the stair down to the crypt in which Mary Magdalene
died after having swallowed a consecrated wafer given her by St.
Maximin. Her body was afterwards put into the elaborately-carved
alabaster sarcophagus on the left side of the altar. The marble
sarcophagus next it contained some bones of the Innocents Mary is said
to have brought with her from Palestine. Opposite Mary’s is the marble
sarcophagus of St. Maximin, 1st cent., and then follow the sarcophagi,
also in sculptured marble, of St. Marcella (Mary’s maid) and St.
Sidonius, 2d cent. They are all empty, having been rifled at the
Revolution of 1793. In the shrine on the altar is the skull of Mary
Magdalene, and in a sort of bottle the greater part of one of her
armbones. (See also under <a href = "#six_fours">Six Fours</a>,

rapidly-increasing place of 3000 inhabitants. In winter its guests come
from the colder regions in quest of warmth, and in summer from the hot

Valescure, 2&nbsp;m. inland, with G. H.&nbsp;de Valescure. St. Raphael,
only 43 minutes from Cannes, makes a salubrious and agreeable residence,
with pleasant walks, either by the beach or up the valley of the Garonne
into the Estérel mountains, where the rambles are endless. At the E. end
of St. Raphael is a very pleasant park, rising from the rocks on the
coast. A&nbsp;little farther towards Cannes is the Boulerie, with a
large hotel.</p>

<p>Napoleon landed at St. Raphael on his return from Egypt in 1799, and

<p>Cannes extends 4½ m. from east to west, partly on the Gulf of Jouan,
and partly on the Gulf of Napoule, covering likewise with its houses and
gardens Cape Croisette, which separates these two gulfs. Landwards it
extends nearly the same distance, where large hotels crown the hills,
and pretty villas with gardens occupy the valleys. The principal square,
called the Allés de la Liberté, is nearly in the centre of the town, at
the head of the Gulf of Napoule, and is about 700 yards long by 110
wide. It contains the Hôtel de Ville and the H.&nbsp;Splendide. Between
them is a marble statue, life-size, “A&nbsp;Lord Brougham, né à
Edinburgh, le 19 Septembre 1778. Décédé à Cannes le 7 Mai 1868.” He is
in his official robes. In his left hand, resting on the top of a palm,
he holds a rose. The Hôtel de Ville contains the Public Library and
interesting collections illustrating the natural history of the
neighbourhood. The obliging director gives every assistance in naming
the plants, insects, and minerals. At the head of the Allées, and on the
adjoining eminence, is the old or original town. On this hill is the
Church of Notre-Dame-d’Espérance, 17th cent., with a reliquary of the
15th. In front is a rudely-constructed wall with embrasures. Above it
are St. Anne, 13th cent., the old chapel of the castle, and the square
tower commenced in 1080 by the Abbot Adalbert&nbsp;II., of the monastery
of St. Honorat. From the top is an extensive view. Near the foot of the
tower is a small observatory. On a much higher hill behind is the new
cemetery, where Lord Brougham was buried on the 24th of May 1868. The
monument consists of a massive lofty cross on a double basement, bearing
the following inscription:&mdash; “HENRICVS BROVGHAM. Natus MDCCLXXVIII.
Decessit MDCCCLXVIII.” Near him lies James, fourth Duke of Montrose,
K.T., died December 1874.</p>

The mean winter temperature is 47° Fahr. The average number of rainy
days in the year is 52, and the annual rainfall 25 inches, the same as
at Nice. “The electrical condition of the climate of Cannes, as well as

Cab with one horse, 14 frs.; with two, 18 frs. Omnibus to Vallauris,

delightful and easy walk along the Corniche road. Cross the Vallauris
bridge a little below Massier’s pottery, and ascend the broad road.
About ½&nbsp;m. from the bridge is the “Observatoire de la Corniche,”
where tea and coffee can be had, and whence there is a charming view
east from Cannes to Bordighera. About half-way between this and the
observatory at the Cannes or S.W. end of the road is the large hotel
Cannes-Eden.</p>

commences near the source of the Siagne, a&nbsp;few miles from St.
Cesaire.</p>

<p>From the Belvédère an excellent carriage-road ascends to a still

<span class = "sidetrip">
Vallauris has long been famous for the manufacture of <a name =
"vallauris_pottery" id = "vallauris_pottery">kitchen pottery</a>,
“Potteries Réfractaires,” earthenware utensils, principally of the
“marmite” or stewpan class, capable of bearing great heat without
cracking. A&nbsp;dozen marmites, in assorted sizes, are sold for
2&nbsp;frs. To this the Massiers and others have added the manufacture
of artistic pottery, of which there is a good display, both in the
showrooms in the village and in those down at the Golfe de Jouan.
Several of the clay-beds may be seen by the side of the road leading up
northwards from Vallauris; but the best and richest strata, all of the
Pleiocene period, are in that valley near the spot where this road meets
the road to Antibes. About 220 yards beyond this meeting-place a cut-up
road ramifies, left, into the valley containing the <a name =

into them are covered with roofing. Any one may descend into them. The
colours of the clay are blue, red, black, and gray, all in various
shades. The most valuable is the blue. Most of the common articles are
made of a mixture of all the clays. Red clay from Estaque, near
Marseilles, is also used in the making of artistic pottery.</span></p>

were from 5 to 8 years old. In gardens in the country the oranges cost
about a sou each, but in the Hesperides they are dearer. The best are
those the second year on the tree. Frosts retard the sweetening process,

ILES DE LERINS.</a></h5>

<p>The Island of Ste. Marguerite, 4½ m. in circumference and 1½&nbsp;m.
from the mainland, is covered entirely with a pine forest, except at
Point Croisette, on which stands the fort founded by Richelieu,
containing the apartments in which Marshal Bazaine was confined and the
far more interesting vaulted cell in which the Man of the Iron Mask was
closely guarded. The present entrance did not exist at that time, the
only communication then being by the now walled-up door which led into
the house of the governor, M. de St. Mars. From behind the prison a
road, bordered by the <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>, goes right through the
pine plantation to the other side of the island.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><a name = "iron_mask" id = "iron_mask">
<span class = "headnote">The Man of the Iron Mask.</span></a></p>

<p>The name of the Man of the Iron Mask was Hercules Anthony Matthioli,
a&nbsp;Bolognese of ancient family, born on the 1st December 1640. On
the 13th of January 1661 he married Camilla, daughter of Bernard
Paleotti, by whom he had two sons, one of whom only had posterity, which
has long since been extinct. Early in life Matthioli was public reader
in the University of Bologna, which he soon quitted to enter the service
of Charles&nbsp;III., Duke of Mantua, by whom he was finally made
Secretary of State. The successor of Charles&nbsp;III., Ferdinand
Charles IV., the last sovereign of Mantua, of the house of Gonzaga,
created Matthioli supernumerary senator of Mantua, and gave him the
title of Count. Towards the end of 1677 the Abbé d’Estrades, ambassador
from France to the Republic of Venice, conceived the idea, which he was
well aware would be highly acceptable to the insatiable ambition of his
master, Louis XIV., of inducing the weak and unfortunate Duke Ferdinand
Charles to allow of the introduction of a French garrison into Casale,
a&nbsp;strongly-fortified town, in a great measure the key of Italy. The
cession of the fortress of Pinerolo to the French by Victor Amadeus,
Duke of Savoy, in 1632, had opened to them the entrance into Piedmont,
while the possession of Casale would have opened to them the broad and
fertile plains of Milan.</p>

<p>The great difficulty Estrades had to encounter at first in the
prosecution of this intrigue was to find a medium of communication
between himself and the Duke. This channel was at last found in the
person of Matthioli, who enjoyed the Duke’s confidence and favour, and
was besides a complete master of Italian politics. Through him the
schemes of Estrades progressed so well that he was invited to the French
court, where he was received and rewarded by Louis XIV.,
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<a name = "page158" id = "page158"> </a>
<!-- png 202 -->
who at the same time presented him with a valuable diamond ring. Shortly
after Matthioli’s return to Italy he allowed himself to be bought over
by the Austrian party, which frustrated the French negotiations and so
exasperated the vindictive Louis that he sent orders to the Abbé
Estrades to have him kidnapped at all hazards.
<span class = "sidetrip">
For this purpose Matthioli was induced to go to the frontier beyond
Turin, where he was arrested as a traitor to France by the Abbé,
accompanied by four soldiers, on 2d May 1679. Such a scandalous breach
of international law required the adoption of extraordinary
precautionary means of concealment. His name was changed to Lestang, he
was compelled to wear a black velvet mask, and when he travelled armed
attendants on horseback were ready to despatch him if he made any
attempt to escape, or even to reveal himself.</span></p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
By the direction of Estrades he was comfortably lodged and fed in
prison, till orders came from Paris, stating&mdash; “It is not the
intention of the king that the Sieur de Lestang should be well treated,
nor receive anything beyond the absolute necessaries of life, nor
anything to make his time pass agreeably.” He was handed over to the
charge of St. Mars, who took him to the castle of Pinerolo, whence in
1681 they removed to the castle of Exiles. From Exiles St. Mars removed
his unfortunate and now crazy prisoner to the Island of Ste. Marguerite,
where they arrived 30th April 1687, after a journey of twelve days.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
Among the erroneous anecdotes told of Matthioli during his ten years’
sojourn on the island are:&mdash;On one occasion he is alleged to have
written his name and rank on a silver plate, which he threw out of the
window. A&nbsp;fisherman picked it up and brought it to St. Mars, who,
on finding the man could not read, let him go. On another occasion
Matthioli is said to have covered one of his shirts with writing, which
he likewise threw out of the window. It was found by a monk, who, when
he delivered it to St. Mars, assured him that he had not read it. Two
days afterwards the monk was found dead. The origin of these stories is
to be found in a letter from St. Mars to the Minister, dated 4th June
1692, in which he informs him that he has been obliged to inflict
corporeal punishment upon a Protestant clergyman named Salves, also in
his keeping, because he would write things on his pewter vessels and
linen, to make known that he was imprisoned unjustly on account of the
purity of his faith.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">

St. Mars had been appointed governor. They arrived on 18th September

on the island, and in 1080 the Abbé Adalbert&nbsp;II. commenced the
castle of Cannes. In 1148 the monks strengthened and enlarged the
fortifications of their tower. In 1788 the monastery was suppressed on
account of the irregularities of the inmates. In 1791 the island and
buildings were sold. In 1859 they were finally bought by the Bishop of
Frejus, who handed them over to the present occupiers, a&nbsp;colony of
Cistercian monks, 50 in number, of whom about two-thirds are lay
brethren.</p>

Iona, till the Synod of Whitby, exercised over Northumbria. All the more

The tower or rather castle, as it now stands, represents two tall
rectangular elevations of unequal magnitude, crowned by projecting
cornices. On the ground-floor, with entrance from the beach, is a large
hall with groined roof, said by some to have been a chapel, and by
others a bakery, but most likely a “parloir” or reception-room. In the
wall, a&nbsp;little to the left or west, and about 30 ft. from the
ground, is a cannon-ball fired by the English when they took possession
of the islands in 1746. The interior of the castle is shown by the
concierge of the convent. The first part entered is the oblong cloister,
in three stories, of which two remain entire. The corridor of the first
is supported on short columns standing round the edge of a cistern. From
this corridor open the doors into the bedrooms and refectory. From the
upper corridor is the entrance to the chapel, which opened into the
library. Above the library was the infirmary, of which not a vestige
remains. A&nbsp;good view is had from the top. Visitors are next taken

By the road round the island are the remains of chapels of the 7th

wall of the convent, a&nbsp;little to the west of the castle, the Chapel
of St. Porcaire (restored), where, it is said, the saint was buried. At
the western extremity of the island, within an old fort, is the Chapel
of St. Sauveur. To the west of the landing-place, near the large
gateway, are little better than the foundations of the Chapel of St.
Pierre. Farther east, beside the Orphanage, is St. Justine, now a
stable. The Orphanage contains about 25 boys. They are taught different
trades. The franc charged for showing the castle goes to their support.

A&nbsp;little way inland is a grassy plot, called the Plain of Napoleon,
because here, on 2d March 1815, he breakfasted at the foot of the three
tall cypresses, and then went on to St. Vallier. In the face of the
large calcareous cliff a few yards beyond the trees is a cavern or
“foux,” whence, after heavy rains, a&nbsp;large body of water issues in
the form of a roaring cascade. The path which leads down into the
beautiful valley below commences about 500 yards farther inland. It
joins that very pretty road among olive trees, seen from the plateau,
which, after passing the large white house, a&nbsp;hospice for the aged,
enters Grasse by the powder-house, formerly the chapel of St. Sauveur,
a&nbsp;little circular building with flat shallow buttresses, built in
the early part of the 10th cent. On entering Grasse by this way, and
just at the commencement of the promenade called the Cours, is the

The standard industries of Grasse are the distilling of perfumes and the
preserving of fruits. The flowers are cultivated on terraces resembling
great nursery-beds. Of the perfumes, the most precious are the Otto of
Roses and the Néroly. It requires 45 lbs. avoirdupois of rose leaves
(petals) to make 1 gramme, or 15½ grains troy of the Otto of Roses,
which costs from 2½ to 3&nbsp;frs. the gramme; and 2¾ lbs. troy of the
petals of orange flowers to make 1 gramme of Néroly, which costs 8 to 10
sous the gramme. The best Néroly, the Néroly Bigarrade, is made from the
flowers of the bitter orange tree. It is used principally in the
manufacture of Eau de Cologne, of which it constitutes the base. In
colour it resembles sherry, and the odour is that of Eau de Cologne. The
water that comes off in distilling Néroly forms the orange-water of the
cafés. The Otto of Roses of Grasse is superior to that of Turkey.
Extracts for scenting pocket-handkerchiefs are made from
freshly-gathered flowers laid between two sheets of glass, held by their
frames 4 inches apart, and piled one above the other, without pressing
the flowers. On each side of the glass is a layer of lard ⅓ of an inch
thick, which, in 12 to 24 hours, absorbs completely the odoriferous oil.
When the flowers are abundant they are renewed every 12 hours, sometimes
even every 6. The operation is repeated several times on the same lard
with fresh flowers. Jonquilles are changed 30 times, the cassia and
violet 60, the tuberose (a&nbsp;kind of hyacinth) and the jasmine, both
80 times. The lard is then melted in a large iron vessel, and mixed with
spirits made from grain, which, combining with the volatile oil, rises
to the top. The fluid is then filtered.
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
<!-- png 206 -->
This is called the cold method. Orange and rose petals require the hot
methods, either by the still or by the “bain-marie.” The distilling of
the fragrant oil from the petals requires the most vigilant attention,
and the maintenance of the same degree of heat. Rose and orange pomade
are made by the bain-marie method by submerging a large iron pot full of
lard in boiling water. When the lard is melted the petals are added, and
after having remained there for 12 or 24 hours the mass is filtered to
remove the now inodorous petals. The operation is repeated from 30 to 60

The bishopric of Vence, founded in 374, was afterwards united to that of
Frejus. In the centre of the town is the cathedral, 110 ft. long, 68 ft.
wide, and about 70 high, inside measure. Two aisles with massive piers
and semicircular arches (slightly stilted) are on each side of the nave.
Above is a triforium 15 ft. wide. Roof waggon-vaulted. The choir,
containing 50 stalls in dark carved oak, is in a gallery opposite the
altar, in the position usually occupied by the organ. At the N.E. corner
of the church is an ancient and beautiful baptismal font, of which,
unfortunately, a&nbsp;large piece of the pedestal is sunk into the
ground. The chancel was formerly a Roman temple. The column now in the
square behind the church, and the other over a well at the west end,
stood formerly at the entrance into the temple. On the table of the
second altar right is part of a sculptured stone which formerly adorned
this temple. In the next chapel is the tomb of St. Lambert, many years
Bishop of Vence, with Latin inscription on table of altar. Under the
chancel is the vault in which the bishops were buried, while the vault
of the Lords of Vence was under the nave. The present “Place” behind the
chancel was the public cemetery. Several stones with inscriptions are on
the walls. One slab bears an eagle in relief, and under it is a still
larger stone sculptured in a diaper pattern, with a stork and crowing
cocks worked into the design. The style resembles that of the old carved
door in the first chapel right of altar, all probably of the 14th or
15th cent.</p>

abundant supply, is limpid and unctuous, and tastes like slightly salt
new milk. Temp. 95° to 100° Fahr. The principal ingredient is the
chloride of soda, and, in less quantities, the chloride of magnesia, the
carbonate of lime, and the sulphate of lime and soda. The water is also
rich in organic substances, such as baregine and glairine along with
other sulphurous compounds, which develop themselves rapidly when the
water is exposed to the action of the air. This organic matter is used
in the mud-baths for the cure of sores and tumours. The baths are
partially sunk into the floor, and are easily entered. The flow of water
into and out of them is constant. Coaches daily from Gréoulx to
Manosque, Mirabeau, and Riez (<a href = "#map163">map,

<i>Hotels:</i> Pascal; Eymon, commanding an extensive view of the
surrounding mountains; near it the G. H.&nbsp;de Versailles; and the
Poste. Manosque is situated on an eminence rising from the plain of the
Durance, nearly surrounded by hills covered with vineyards and olive
trees. Portions of the town walls and towers still remain, and the
eastern and western gateways have been repaired and restored. Entering
the town by the gate close to the hotels, we ascend the narrow and
badly-paved principal street to the church of St. Sauveur, easily
recognised by the square belfry attached to the S.E. end. Within the
main entrance are two large caryatides. The windows of the façade are
circular, the others small and round-headed with modern glass. On each
side of the nave are semicircular arches of a great span; the chancel is
extremely shallow, the roof 4 partite, and the floor considerably lower
than the street. The narrow lane opposite the corner of the façade leads
to the principal “Place,” where there is a fountain, and whence there is
a good view. Higher up the principal street is Notre Dame, in exactly
the same style as St. Sauveur. The table or altar in the chapel to the
left of the high altar is formed of a marble sarcophagus, 5th cent.,
with figures, in bold relief, of the apostles, and in the centre a
crucifixion. Above is a black image of Mary and child, supposed to date
from the 6th cent. In the Hôtel de Ville is a silver bust by Puget of
Gérard Jung, the founder of the order of the Hospitallers,
a&nbsp;religious community whose office was to relieve the stranger, the
poor, and the sick. In the neighbourhood are deposits of gypsum and
lignite. Coach daily to Riez, 5 hrs., 22&nbsp;m. E.; to the baths of

<p>Nice occupies a plain bounded by the limestone summits of the
Maritime Alps, whence descend fertile wooded ridges composed of a
reddish conglomerate and a gray-blue clay of the Pleiocene period.
Between these ridges are deep vallons, gullies, or furrows, with
precipitous sides, scooped out to a great depth by the intermittent
action of torrents, the breadth and depth of the valleys depending on
the volume of water in the stream and the degree of consistence of the
conglomerate. The great vallons have tributary vallons. The pleasant
Vallon de Magnan exemplifies both kinds. From the Pont de Magnan (near
which a tram stops) the first tributary is nearly a mile up the stream,
opening from the right or west side. This vallon is short, the walls
nearly perpendicular, and in some parts scarcely 2 ft. apart. Higher up
the Magnan, and opening from the left or east side, next a church, is
the more beautiful and more extensive tributary vallon, the Madeleine,
which high up becomes so narrow and so choked with troublesome brambles
as to be almost impassable. The banks are covered with vegetation, and
the more level parts with maritime pines and olive trees. At the
entrance are beds of clay of immense thickness, of which
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>

<!-- png 221 -->
fire-bricks are made. The Mantéga Vallon, entered from the Chemin de
Mantéga (see plan), has great walls of clay and conglomerate. The softer
conglomerate is quarried and broken up for its sandy dolomitic material,
which, mixed with lime, makes excellent mortar.</p>

<p>The city of Nice consists of three distinct parts:&mdash;1st, the new
or fashionable quarter, stretching westwards from the Paillon,
containing avenues and gardens, and broad and well-paved streets
bordered with large and elegant buildings, of which a large proportion
are hotels and “pensions;” 2d, the Old Town, a&nbsp;perfect labyrinth of
narrow, dirty, steep streets, radiating from the Cathedral as a sort of
centre, and running up the sides of the Château hill, which separates it
from, 3d, the Port, with its seafaring population, and about 16 acres of
harbour.</p>

<p>During the season, from November to April, Nice is a luxurious city,
with the attractions and resources of the great northern capitals. In
winter the population may be estimated at 90,000, whereas in summer it
is only about 54,000, a&nbsp;diminution in numbers apparent only in the
largest and most elegant part of the city. The non-fluctuating
population inhabit the crowded tenements in the narrow streets huddled
together between the Paillon and the Château hill.</p>

<p>The glory of Nice is the Promenade des Anglais, commenced by the
English in 1822 to employ the poor during a season of scarcity. This
beautiful terraced walk, 85 ft. broad, extends 2&nbsp;m. along the beach
of the Baie des Anges, from the Quai Lunel of the Port to the mouth of
the Magnan, whence it will be continued other 3&nbsp;m. west to the
mouth of the river Var, near the Racecourse.</p>

<p>Over the Port rises the <a name = "nice_castle" id =
"nice_castle"><b>Castlehill</b></a>, 315 ft., commanding from the
platform, in every direction, the most charming views. To the E. are the
peninsula of St. Jean and Cape Boron, and rising from it, Fort
Montalban, Mt. Vinaigrier, and the Observatory residence and buildings.
To the N. is Mt. Chauve; to the E. the roofs of Nice; and in the
distance the <a href = "#roche_blanche">Roche-Blanche</a> (p.&nbsp;164),
the peninsula of Antibes, and the Estérels. This fortress, founded by
the early Phœnician colonists, and destroyed and rebuilt at various
periods afterwards, was finally razed to the ground in 1706, by order of
Louis XIV., by Maréchal Berwick. Now it has become the great park of
Nice. A&nbsp;round tower that still remains, over the Hôtel des Princes,
called the Tour Bellanda, was probably added to the Castle by Emmanuel
Philibert in 1560. On the W. side of the hill (see plan) is the <a name
= "nice_cemetery" id = "nice_cemetery">cemetery</a> in five stages. At
the entrance is the monument to the “Victimes de l’Incendie du Theatre,
23d March 1881.” Towards the E. end, at the wall, is the grave of

Rosa Garibaldi, d.&nbsp;19th March 1852. The tombstone was placed by her
son, General Garibaldi. In the highest terrace is the grave containing
Gambetta and his mother. In a terrace by itself in the eastern end is
the Protestant cemetery.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><a name = "caterina_segurana" id =

<p>Near the harbour, and above the Quai Lunel, is the statue of King
Charles Felix. In the Rue du Murier, leading down from the Rue Segurane
to the Port, is the mulberry tree where Caterina Segurana had her tent.
On the 15th of August 1543 she, at the head of a devoted band, attacked
the allied French and Turkish forces commanded by François de Bourbon
and the Turk Barbarossa, struck down with her own hand the
standard-bearer, and put the enemy to flight. Giuseppe Garibaldi was
born, 19th July 1807, in a house which stood at the head of the Port
before its enlargement. In a small street, ramifying from the Rue
Segurane, is the church of St. Augustin, in which Luther preached in
1510. At the east end of the R. de la Préfecture, last street left, No.
15 R. Droite, is the Palais des Lascaris, with ceilings painted in
fresco by Carlone. It is now the “École Professionnelle.” This is also
the street of the jewellers patronised by the peasantry. Paganini died
(1840) in the house No. 14 R. de la Préfecture. The jambs and lintels of
the doorway are slightly decorated. The Cathedral and the other churches
in the old town are in the Italian style, ornamented with gilding and
variously-coloured marbles. The new church, Notre Dame, in the Avenue de
la Gare, is Gothic in style. The first non-Romanist church erected in
Nice was the Episcopal chapel of the Trinity in 1822. As it became too
small, the present church was built on the same site in 1856 at a cost
of £6000. To the N.W. of the railway station, by the Chemin St. Etienne,
in an orange grove, is the
<span class = "headnote float"><a name = "nice_memorial_chapel" id =

Russian Memorial Chapel, a&nbsp;series of ascending domes, built over
the spot on which stood the villa in which the Prince Imperial of Russia
died, April 24, 1865. The interior is covered with designs in gold leaf,
varied here and there by a light-blue ground. Round the base runs a
white marble panelling, enclosing frescoes of saints in niches.</p>

<p>The principal thoroughfares in Nice are the Place Massena and the
handsome broad street the “Avenue de la Gare,” extending in a straight
line northward from the “Place” to the station. Next in importance are
the Quais Massena and St. Jean Baptiste. In the above are all the best
shops. The Rue Massena, and its continuation the Rue de France, behind
the Promenade des Anglais, contain shops principally of the provision
kind, British stores, grocers, wine merchants, confectioners,
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>

and dressmakers. At the east end of the <a name = "nice_croix_marbre" id
= "nice_croix_marbre"><b>Rue de France</b></a> is the Croix de Marbre,
a&nbsp;marble crucifix under a canopy on four marble columns, erected in
1568 to commemorate the visit of Charles&nbsp;V., Francis&nbsp;I., and
Paul&nbsp;III. in 1538, and the partial reconciliation of the two
potentates through the intervention of the Pope. The column opposite
commemorates the visits of Pio VII. in 1809 and in February 1814. Near
this is Trinity Church, and in the Rue Gioffredo the Temple Évangélique,
the second Protestant church built in Nice.</p>

<p>On the arched part of the Paillon, fronting the Quai St. Jean, is the
large and handsome Casino, and a little farther up the river the pretty
public garden called the Square Massena, with a statue in the centre, in
an animated posture, of André Massena, Prince of Essling and Marshal of
France, who was born on May 7, 1758, in a house now demolished, which
stood on the Quai St. Jean Baptiste. In 1810 he was chosen by Napoleon
to stop the advance of Wellington in Portugal, and was commissioned “to
drive the English and their Sepoy general into the sea.” But the wary
strategy and imperturbable firmness of the British general proved
resistless, and Massena was compelled to save his military fame by a
masterly retreat. On the pedestal Clio is seen writing his name in the
chronicles of his native city. This garden forms a pleasant lounge, but
it is not so fashionable as the other farther down, at the mouth of the
river, called the “Jardin Public,” planted with magnolias, acacias,
Japan medlars, and gum, cork, camphor, and pepper trees. The band plays
here in the afternoon. The most beautiful of the public gardens is on
the Castlehill, intersected by footpaths and carriage-roads up to the
summit. On one side of the hill is the public cemetery.</p>

<p>All the side streets which ramify eastward from the Avenue de la Gare
lead to the Quartier Carabacel, one of the most sheltered parts of Nice,
and inhabited by the most delicate invalids. Above it, about 2&nbsp;m.
distant, or 3&nbsp;from the Place Massena, is <a name = "cimies" id =

spot, frequented principally by nervous invalids requiring a sedative
climate. On the top of this hill stood the Roman city Cemenelium, of
which all that remains are the ruins of an amphitheatre 210 ft. long by
175 wide. Just under the Boulevard Prince de Galles are artistic ruins
composed of ancient material gathered in this neighbourhood. They stand
in the spacious grounds of the superb villa Val Rose, which in shape
resembles Noe’s ark. Entrance from behind G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Windsor. The

1543 on the site of a temple of Diana.

The altar-pieces of the two chapels to the right of the altar were
painted by Ludovico Brea, a&nbsp;contemporary of Raphael, and the only
artist of eminence Nice has produced. The cemetery contains some
beautiful tombstones. In the centre of the “Place,” on a spiral marble
column, is a crucifix with a winged J.&nbsp;C. Above is a pelican
feeding its young, a&nbsp;favourite Christian symbol of charity during
the Middle Ages.</p>

be found; and, though the first impressions may be very unfavourable,
the writer [Ed.] has usually obtained food and a bed such as a

accessible at seasons when travellers are shut out by climate from most
other Alpine districts, this offers special attractions to the
naturalist. Within a narrow range may be found a considerable number of
very rare plants, several of which are not known to exist elsewhere. The
geology is also interesting, and would probably repay further

olive tree, not far from a restaurant. Near the Church on the Monaco
road is the Restaurant Beau-Rivage, where a Bouillabaisse lunch can be
had. In the creek below are small boats for hire. Beaulieu is really a
beautiful place. It is situated in one of the most sheltered nooks of
the Riviera, at the foot of gigantic cliffs with patches of strata of
reddish sandstone. The edges of this grand precipice are fringed with
trees, which in the bright atmosphere look almost as if they were
transparent; while below, groves of stately olive trees cover the base
and struggle as far up as they can by the fissures in the rocks. Behind
the olives, and intermixed with them, are orchards of orange and lemon
trees, bending under the weight of their beautiful fruit. Trees and tall
shrubs hang over the edges of the abrupt banks, which enclose the tiny
creeks and bays bordered with diminutive sandy beaches, or with long
ledges of marble rocks, dipping gradually down into the deep-blue water,
carpeted in some places with the thin flat siliceous leaves of the
Posidonia Caulini, a&nbsp;Naiad not an alga, which covers the shore of
the Mediterranean, and of which great accumulations are seen thrown up

passing the signal-tower to the right.</p>

<p>The port of St. Jean, <i>Inn:</i> H.&nbsp;Victoria, is used
principally by the tunny fishing-boats from February to April. It makes
a very pleasant residence for artists and naturalists. It is situated
among creeks and bays, gardens, orchards, villas, and woods, in the most
fertile part of the peninsula. Beyond, on the highest point of the
peninsula of St. Hospice, is a round tower, the remains of the
fortifications razed by the Duke of Berwick in 1706. The more ancient
crumbling masonry around belonged to a stronghold of the Saracens,
whence they were driven in the 10th cent. “A&nbsp;fir-clad mound amid

<p>The most picturesque part of the Monaco road is between Beaulieu and
Eze, the next station, 2&nbsp;m. distant by road, but only 1½ by rail.
The steep flanks of the mountains between Beaulieu and Cape Roux are so
exposed to the sun, and so protected from the cold, that this region has
been called the <a name = "petite_afrique" id =
"petite_afrique"><b>Petite Afrique</b></a>. Cape Roux itself, the abrupt
termination of a lofty ridge, looks as if it would topple over into the
sea, to which it is so close that both the rail and the road have to
pass through it by tunnels. On the eastern side of this cape is the
equally picturesque and sheltered bay, the Mer d’Eze, backed by a
phalanx of lofty stalwart cliffs and mountains. On the peak (1300 ft.
high) of one of this confused assemblage of lofty calcareous rocks is
the nearly deserted village of <b>Eze</b>, pop. 770, with the ruins of
its castle founded by the Saracens in 814, and its small church,
recently restored, built on the foundations of a temple of Isis, whence
the name Eza or Eze is said to be derived. From the floor of rock of the
castle, under the remains of a vaulted roof, a&nbsp;charming marine
landscape displays itself, while inland is seen the Pass or highest part
(1750 ft.) of the Corniche road, which here crosses the ridge terminated
by Mt. Roux. At the Pass are an inn and a few houses. The road up to Eze
commences near the station. In some parts it is steep, and much exposed
to the sun, and throughout very picturesque and stony, passing through
plantations of firs, olives, and carouba or locust trees. The ascent
requires, doing it leisurely, 75 minutes. From Eze a road ascends to the
Corniche road, and another descends to St. Laurent, on the road to
Monaco. A&nbsp;little beyond Eze is the station for La Turbie.</p>

<p><b>Monaco proper</b>, pop. 1200. Hôtel de la Paix, 7½ frs., splendid
view from the square. Pharmacies under the direction of MM. Cruzel and
Muratore. Till the arrival of F.&nbsp;Blanc in 1860, Monaco was a poor
place, where the Prince and his subjects had to maintain themselves from
the produce of a few small vineyards and orchards scattered over patches
of scanty soil on the slopes of the mountains. But now that the
gambling-tables have brought a flood of gold into the principality,
wealth has taken the place of poverty, the palace has been furnished
anew, the humble Grimaldi church, 13th cent., thrown down, and in its
stead a majestic cathedral erected, the barns have been filled with
plenty, costly roads have been cut through the cliffs, the formerly arid
hills clothed with exuberant verdure, and beautiful villas have been
built in the midst of enchanting gardens, in places where, only a few
years ago, hardly enough of short wiry grass could grow to feed a goat.
The gambling establishment of Monaco was opened in 1856 by a company
with the sanction of Prince Charles&nbsp;III. The first house was in the
Place du Château; whence, after sundry changes, the company commenced to
build a house in 1858 on Monte Carlo. Becoming short of funds, they sold
their rights and property in 1860 to François Blanc.</p>

<p>The Grimaldi family have been in possession of this small territory
since 968, when the Emperor Otto&nbsp;I. gave it to Grimaldi&nbsp;I.,
Lord of Antibes and father of Giballin Grimaldi, who drove the Saracens
from the Grand-Fraxinet of <a href = "#st_tropez">St. Tropez</a>
(p.&nbsp;145). The greatest length of the principality, from the
cemetery wall at the western extremity to the brook St. Roman at the
eastern, is (including curves) 3½&nbsp;m., and the greatest breadth,
from Point St. Martin northwards, 1&nbsp;m. Population 10,000,
distributed among four different centres&mdash;the city, or Monaco
proper; the port, or La Condamine; Monte Carlo; and Les Moulins. They
are all united excepting the city, which, like an eagle’s nest, occupies
its own isolated rock, and is the one clean old town on the whole coast
of the Mediterranean, and, although about 200 ft. above the sea, is most
easily accessible by well-planned and gently-sloping roads.

<p>Monte Carlo is not an isolated rock like Monaco, but the abrupt
termination of a ridge sloping upwards from Point Focinana to the
Corniche road and the Château Mountains, both a considerable way beyond
the territory of Monaco. On the face of Monte Carlo, or rather of
Focinana Point, is the Casino, a&nbsp;large and showy building, erected
in 1862 by F.&nbsp;Blanc (d.&nbsp;1877), a&nbsp;native of Avignon, and
formerly the

proprietor of the Cursaal of Homburg. To the right of the entrance into
the Casino are the cloak-rooms, the ladies’ (dames) and gentlemen’s
(hommes) lavatories, and the reading-room. Fronting the entrance is the
concert-room&mdash;a superb rectangular hall profusely decorated with
gilt ornaments intermingled with paintings in fresco representing the
Muses and mythological subjects. It is furnished with 600 cushioned
arm-chairs covered with scarlet velvet. The stage, or the part occupied
by the orchestra, is less ornamented, and the colours are more subdued.
Directly opposite is a sumptuous gallery for the use of the prince and
his suite, entered from the large door at the west side of the Casino.
The orchestra consists of nearly 80 first-class musicians, of whom about
three-fourths play on stringed instruments. To the left of the entrance
are the <a name = "monaco_gambling_rooms" id =
"monaco_gambling_rooms">gambling-rooms</a> and the office where visitors
give their names and addresses before entering. In the first three rooms
are the tables for roulette, which is played with one zero, and at which
the smallest sum admitted is 5&nbsp;frs., and the largest 6000 frs. or
£240. The fourth room, ornamented with panel paintings by Clairin and
Boulanger, representing young lady riders, croquet-players, fencers,
fishers, archers, mountaineers, shooters, and sailors, is devoted to
trente-et-quarante, at which the smallest sum admitted is 20 frs., and
the largest 12,000 frs. or £480. Only French coin and notes taken at the
tables.</p>

<p>Charming gardens and lawns with exquisite turf surround the Casino,
and under it, at the foot of the cliff, is a large pigeon-shooting
gallery. Entrance, 5&nbsp;frs. Well-constructed carriage-drives and
footpaths ramify in all directions, up the hill to the Corniche road,
and along the coast either to Menton or to Nice by the magnificent
coast-road to <a href = "#villefranche">Villefranche</a> (see
p.&nbsp;184). The whole hill itself, or rather slope, is studded, even
beyond the boundaries of Monaco, with beautiful villas, partially hidden
among orange, lemon, and olive trees. On the eastern side of Monte Carlo
is <a name = "les_moulins" id = "les_moulins"><b>Les Moulins</b></a>,

the Hôtel du Parc.</p>

<p>At the Casino it is not necessary to gamble, while those inclined to
that horrid vice will find more dangerous traps laid to catch them in
the clubs of the principal towns on the Riviera. In Monte Carlo no one
can gamble on credit.

St. Roman, with some very large olive and locust trees. In the
principality are also large groves of lemon trees. They flower and bear
fruit throughout the whole year. The lemons, which ripen in spring, are
called graneti, and those which ripen in summer verdami. They are the
juiciest, and as they keep longest, are the most suitable for
exportation. The best paper for wrapping them in is that made from old
tarry ropes. The manure preferred for the lemon and olive trees is
composed of the waste of horns, woollen rags, and refuse.</p>

<p><i>Excursions.</i>&mdash;1640 feet above Monaco is <b>La Turbie</b>,
ascended by a road containing 860 terraced steps, of which the best are
14 feet long by 9&nbsp;feet wide, but a great many are smaller, and the
most are in bad condition. The ascent, walking leisurely, requires one
hour. It commences from the Rue de Turbie, the second street left from
the railway station. At Turbie, pop. 2400, there are three
restaurants&mdash;the France, Paris, and Ancre; the first is the most
frequented. Bedrooms, 2&nbsp;frs. Delicious lemonade, most grateful
after a hot climb. When up at La Turbie ascend by the tower of Augustus

Tête de Chien.</a></h5>

<p>The road to it ramifies from the Corniche road at the west end of
<b>La Turbie</b>. Carriages drive all the way. As there is a Fort on the
top, permission must be procured from the captain to approach the brow
of the mighty projecting precipice, which by its position commands a
splendid uninterrupted view east and west, but spoils that from the
other places. From the Tête de Chien eastward are seen every mountain,
town, village, cape, creek, and bay the length of San Remo. On the
western side the view is much more extensive, reaching to St. Tropez and
the Maure mountains. The east side embraces Monaco, Monte Carlo, Les
Moulins, Mt. de la Justice, Mt. Gros, Roquebrune, Cape St. Martin,
Menton, Ventimiglia, Braja and Bordighera on the Cape San Ampeglio,
which conceals San Remo, but not the entrance into the bay. The western
side embraces Eze, Cape Roux, Beaulieu, the whole of the peninsula of
St. Jean, a&nbsp;piece of Villefranche, the greater part of Nice,
Antibes, the lighthouse and peninsula, the Lerins islands, the Esterel
mountains, and the Maures above Saint Tropez, which close the view.
A&nbsp;good opera-glass should be taken. A&nbsp;stony road leads down
the west side of the Tête, through a plantation of firs, to the Monaco
road, which it joins near the battery (see <a href = "#map185">map,

ancient Trophræa Augusti station, on the Via Julia, is a poor village,
composed of narrow streets, old houses, and gateways close to the
massive Roman fort, which, after having stood nearly intact for 1700
years, was reduced to its present dilapidated condition by a prince of
Monaco in the reign of Louis XIV. The village is supplied with excellent
water from a spring to the N.W. of Mt. Agel. To the west of Turbie, at
the Colonna del Ré, a&nbsp;road descends northwards to the sanctuary of
Notre Dame de Laguet, at the foot of Mt. Sembole, 13&nbsp;m. from Nice,
but scarcely 2&nbsp;from La Turbie.</p>

<p>The conical hill, rising over La Turbie, is Mt. la Bataille, and the
long ridge farther east, leading up to Mt. Agel, 3771 ft., are the
Château mountains. The view from none of these mountains equals that
from the Tête de Chien; moreover, the ascent is uninteresting, by stony
paths. Ascend by the first road east from Turbie, and when at the Turbie
reservoir turn to the left for the Montagne de la Bataille; but for the
Chateau mountains take the path to the right. This path leads round into
a narrow ascending valley, at the top of which is the summit of the
Château mountains, and the commencement of the peak of Mt. Agel, one
half-hour higher. The mountain immediately over Monte Carlo and Les
Moulins is La Justice, 911 ft., used as a quarry. On the top is a pillar
of rough stones, rudely plastered together. By the side of it are the
remains of a similar column. At the chapel of St Roch a road leads up to
the Corniche road (see <a href = "#map185">map, page 185</a>).</p>

<p>Menton is situated round a large bay, bounded on the west by Cape St.
Martin, and on the east by Mortola Point. This bay is divided into two
smaller bays by the hill, 130 ft. high, on which the old town is built.
The platform of the parish church, St. Michel, is reached by 95 steps in
8 divisions. All the streets about it are narrow, dirty, steep, and even
slippery. The new town stretches out a great way along the beach. The
public promenade (about 40 ft. wide) bends round the west bay from the
town to Cape St. Martin. A&nbsp;kind of gloom pervades Menton. The strip
of ground on which it stands is narrow, and so are the streets.
Immediately behind rise great mountains with dark gray limestone cliffs,
intermingled with deep green olive trees and stiff straggling pines. The
valleys are narrow and sombre. The roads up the mountains are steep,
badly paved, and are generally traversed on unwilling donkeys.</p>

<p>The pleasantest walks and drives are those along the coast, extending
from Cape St. Martin to the Italian frontier, to which there are two
roads, an upper and a lower. The former, the main road, crosses the
bridge of St. Louis, while the latter skirts the beach to the famous
bone-caverns. The <i>débris</i> found in these caves, like the
shell-banks in the north of Scotland, consisted of the waste
accumulation from the food of the early inhabitants, together with the
stone implements they had employed. Four of the caves are above the
railway, a&nbsp;little beyond the viaduct under the Italian
custom-house, and two are just below the line close to the beach.</p>

stream Gorbio and by one of its affluents. The streets are narrow,
steep, and roughly paved; the houses poor but substantial; and the
little church, built in 1683, is dedicated “Soli Deo.” At the upper end
of the village is a beautiful tulip tree. The path northward from the
tree leads to Mt. Gorbio, 2707 ft., and to Mt. Baudon, 7144 ft. The
rough stony road leading to the right or eastward from the tree ascends,
in less than 2 hrs., to St. Agnès. It is easily followed, and unfolds
lovely views. <a name = "st_agnes" id = "st_agnes"><b>St. Agnès</b></a>,

<p>From the village descend to Menton by the path on the W. side of the
village, which, after innumerable windings, reaches the road by the side
of the Gorbio. On the way down it is difficult, among the network of
execrable paths, to follow the right one, which in descending is not of
much consequence, but in ascending adds immensely to the fatigue. If the
traveller should stray into the Vallon Castagnec or Primevères, the bed
of the stream should be followed as much as possible. One excursion

<a href = "#sospel">p.&nbsp;182</a>). Excellent carriage-road all the way,
ascending by the western or railway station side of the Carrei. In the
lower part of the valley are large plantations of lemon trees. To the
left of the road near the octroi are Les Moulins olive-oil mills, with
four stages of water-wheels. 4&nbsp;m. farther up the valley of the
Carrei, on a eminence considerably above the stream, are the church and
straggling village of <a name = "monti" id = "monti"><b>Monti</b></a>.
The bridle-road that descends here to the Carrei crosses over to
Castellar, well seen on the opposite side. About a mile beyond Monti,
opposite the part of the road where it makes a sudden bend to the left,
is seen a small stone bridge on the other side of the Carrei. This
bridge crosses the stream that forms the cascade called the
Gourg-d’Ora.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards to the west of the bridge, on the face of an

<p>The inside of the grotto is composed of two rooms; the first, 6 yds.

27 yds. At this extremity a large cavity leads into a second room, 3
yds. long, with a floor sloping in the opposite direction to the

retired from grief.</p>

<p>At the time when King Philip Augustus had summoned all his nobility
to take part in the third crusade, a&nbsp;lord, named Robert de Ferques,
hastened to join the banner of the Count of Boulogne, his sovereign.
This Robert de Ferques had been recently married, and his young bride,
Jehanne de Leulinghem, unable to bear the thought of separation,
resolved to follow her lord and share his toils. She succeeded by
concealing her sex under a man’s dress, and set out with joy in the
capacity of esquire. Unhappily, during the journey she fell from her
horse, and was forced to stop at an inn.

Ferques was obliged, with broken heart, to follow the army, and abandon
his young wife to the care of a faithful servant. But in a few days the
old esquire came with tears in his eyes to announce to his master the
death of the courageous Jehanne. The poor knight was so overwhelmed with
grief that, with the consent of the Count of Boulogne, he resolved to
give up the world, and consecrate to God, in the most austere solitude,
a&nbsp;life which he had already almost sacrificed to Him in war with
the infidels. In 1528 he seems to have been succeeded by the anchoret

“A cool but sunny atmosphere, so dry that a fog is never seen at any
period of the winter, whatever the weather, either on sea or on land,
must be bracing, invigorating, stimulating. Such, indeed, are the
leading characteristics of the climate of this region&mdash;the
Undercliff of western Europe. Such a climate is perfection for all who
want bracing, renovating&mdash;for the very young, the invalid
middle-aged, and the very old, in whom vitality, defective or flagging,
requires rousing and stimulating. The cool but pleasant temperature, the
stimulating influence of the sunshine, the general absence of rain or of
continued rain, the dryness of the air, render daily exercise out of
doors both possible and agreeable. I&nbsp;selected Menton as my winter
residence six years ago, because I was suffering from advanced pulmonary
consumption, and after six winters passed at Menton&nbsp;I am now
surrounded by a little tribe of cured or arrested consumption cases.
This curative result has only been attained, in every instance, by
rousing and improving the organic powers, and principally those of
nutrition. If a consumption patient can be improved in health, and thus
brought to eat and sleep well, thoroughly digesting and assimilating
food, the battle is half won; and helping the physician to attain this
end is the principal benefit of the winter climate of the Riviera.”

“With all its vaunted security from biting winds, and its mountain
shelter from the northern blasts, Menton lies most invitingly open to
the south, south-east, and south-west, and winter winds from these
directions can be chilly enough at times. What tells so keenly upon the
weak and susceptible is the land breeze, which regularly at sundown
steals from the mountains towards the sea. The mean temperature of
November is 54°, December 40°, February 49°, March 53°. When the air is
still, a&nbsp;summer heat often prevails during the day, though in the

<p>Old San Remo is built on two hills, and the modern town at the foot
of these hills, on the Nice and Genoa road, called at this part the Via
Vittorio Emanuele, where are now all the best hotels, restaurants,
booksellers, confectioners, and dealers in inlaid woods. “The mean
temperature is 49°.1 Fahr. (Sigmund), nearly as high as Dr. Bennet’s
estimate of that of Menton; while it would appear, from a comparison of
the thermometrical tables kept by Dr. Daubeny with those of Dr. Bennet
for the same winter, that the range of temperature at Menton is nearly
3° more than at San Remo. The climate is warm and dry, but from the
protecting ranges not rising precipitously as at Menton, the shelter
from the northerly winds is less complete. At the same time the vast
olive groves screen the locality from cold blasts and temper them into
healthful breezes, imparting a pleasing freshness to the atmosphere, and
removing sensations of lassitude often experienced in too well-protected
spots. The size of the sheltered area gives patients a considerable
choice of residences, which can be found either close to or at varying
distances from the sea, according to the requirements of the case; while
the numerous wooded valleys, abounding in exquisite wild flowers,
provide plenty of donkey and foot excursions.” &mdash;Williams’

<p>One of the most frequented excursions is to <a name = "san_romolo" id
= "san_romolo"><b>San Romolo</b></a>, 1700 ft. above the sea, and
4&nbsp;m. northwards, either from the Place St. Etienne, or the Place
St. Sir. Donkey, there and back, 5&nbsp;frs. San Romolo consists of some
villas, an old convent, and a chapel, built over the cell which was
inhabited by the hermit St. Romolo. It commands splendid views, and from
it the ascent is made of the Piano del Ré, a&nbsp;ridge 3500 ft. above
the sea, between Mounts Caggio or Cuggio and Bignone. To reach the
ridge, descend a short way the Romolo road, then take the path to the
left, and make for the corner next Monte Bignone, whence the bridle-path
ascends to the summit, 4235 ft. above the sea, 5 hrs. from San Remo, or
about half that time from San Romolo. “In making the ascent of Monte
Bignone, it is always safest to be accompanied by a guide. For those who
are strong the ascent on foot is the pleasantest, but the road is quite
practicable for sure-footed donkeys, although in places it is somewhat
trying for those whose nerves are not strong. The whole route is
exceedingly beautiful, glorious prospects meeting the eye at almost
every turn; the path sometimes traverses forests of fir trees, with
amongst them innumerable bushes of the bright-leaved holly, at others it
runs along the edges of steep ravines and precipices: many curious and
rare wild flowers attracting the eye on the way; till at length, after
an ascent of about two hours from San Romolo and four from San Remo, the
broad sloping and grassy summit of the mountain is reached. Continue the
ascent until its highest point, marked by a stone obelisk, is gained,
and from which one of the most magnificent prospects imaginable

lies stretched out on all sides, embracing an area in some directions of
more than a hundred and fifty miles, astonishing and enchanting the
beholder. To the south, the glorious expanse of the Mediterranean, and
in the far distance the island of Corsica, with the snowy peaks of Monte
Rotondo; on the right Monte Caggio, and the mountains forming the
western half of the San Remo amphitheatre, terminating at Capo Nero
surmounted by Colla, and the valleys of San Remo and Bordighera; farther
away, the mountains of the Mentonean amphitheatre, and along the coast
successively the various capes and promontories as far as Cap d’Antibes
and even the Esterels; on the left the Ceriana and Taggia Valleys, with
on the farther side of the latter Castellaro and the Madonna di
Lampeduza, and Pompeiana and Riva on the seashore; while far away to the
east are the mountains of the Eastern Riviera or of the Riviera di
Levante, with the Apennines in the distance; lastly, to the north is a
broad and deep valley, having on the other side a range of mountains
still loftier than the one on which we are standing, and above these
again, the snow-capped Alps stretching away in the one direction towards
the Esterels, and in the other to Turin. Looking now more closely into
the valley below, on a narrow ridge on the near side of the valley, is
seen the town of Perinaldo, and on a hill on the opposite side,
Apricale; both of a singularly deep red hue, from the fact that the
tiled roofs only of the houses are seen from this great altitude. There
is a pathway leading down to Bajardo, and thence to Pigna, where
accommodation at a small but clean inn may be had for the night; whence
the return home can then be made by the Nervia valley and Bordighera,
altogether a most beautiful and varied excursion. (For the valley of the

<p>“It is impossible to convey in words anything like a correct idea of
the splendour of the prospect on a clear day from Monte Bignone; it must
be seen to be appreciated; it has been described as one of the finest in
Europe. The excursion is one which may be safely undertaken with
ordinary precautions, and is within the compass of any person of fair
health and strength. An additional charm consists in the number of rare
and beautiful wild flowers, which are different from those found at a
lower elevation. Amongst the most noticeable of these is the blue
Hepatica, Anemone, Hepatica&nbsp;L., a&nbsp;pink variety of which is
sometimes met with, the pink cyclamen-like flower, Erythronium Dens

Gentiana verna and G.&nbsp;acaulis&nbsp;L.; Ophrys fusca Link, also a
species of Asphodel, Asphodelus albus Willd.; Saxifraga cuneifolia;

laureola L.&nbsp;With two or three exceptions, these flowers were found
in blossom at the end of April, but they had been so for some weeks
previously. On my way up the San Romolo valley I noticed many plants of
Helleborus fœtidus&nbsp;L., as also for the first time in flower the
large and handsome pink Cistus, C.&nbsp;albidus&nbsp;L.; this is the

<p>Genoa is singularly constructed around a small bay on shelving
ground, rising rapidly from the water’s edge to the height of from 500
to 600 feet. The old part of the town is a labyrinth of crooked streets
from 6 to 12 feet wide, and frequently so steep that steps have to be
cut in them. The most remarkable of the new streets is the Via di
Circonvallazione, composed of a series of lofty terraced “corsos”
skirting the face of the hills, commencing at the E. end from the Piazza
Manin, 330 ft. above the sea, and extending westward in a zigzag form to
the railway station by the Albergo dei Poveri. They are reached from the
upper ends of the Vias Palestro, Mameli, Caffaro, and Brignone di
Ferrari, by ramps and long stairs. The palaces, another feature of
Genoa, are large gaunt mansions, all similar in style&mdash;gates 40
feet high, with marble columns&mdash;courts paved with various coloured
marbles&mdash;broad staircases, all of marble&mdash;rooms 30 feet high
with arched ceilings, and adorned with gilded columns, large mirrors,
crystal lustres, and mosaic floors; the roofs panelled, and the panels

divided by sculptured figures, and filled with finely executed paintings
in oil. The best churches and palaces are in the streets extending in a
continuous and slightly curved line from the railway station, at the
west end, to the Piazza de Ferrari at the eastern end of Genoa.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><a name = "genoa_palaces" id = "genoa_palaces">
<span class = "headnote">Genoa: Palaces. Palazzo Doria.</span></a></p>

<p>The visiting of the palaces is rather fatiguing, as the best works of
art are preserved in the upper stories, reached by splendid but lofty
staircases. The best two are close to each other, the Palazzo Durazzo
Pallavicini, No.&nbsp;1 Via Balbi, and the Palazzo Rosso, No. 18 Via
Garibaldi. They contain specimens of everything for which the palaces
are remarkable. A&nbsp;fee of 1&nbsp;fr. is sufficient to leave with the
keeper of the gallery. Most of the palaces have each of the rooms
provided with a list of the pictures and frescoes it contains printed on
a card, which makes the visitor quite independent of the servants and
guides.</p>

<p>As there are so many places to visit between the railway station and
the cathedral, the best plan is to do that portion on foot, and after
having visited the cathedral, to take a cab from the stand at the foot
of the Via S.&nbsp;Lorenzo, and drive by the Via Vittorio Emanuele,
round by the ramparts, and up the Via Rivoli to the church of Sta. Maria
di Carignano.</p>

<p>The only palace west from the station is the <a name =
"genoa_pal_doria" id = "genoa_pal_doria"><b>Palazzo Doria</b></a>,
reconstructed by Montorsoli, 1525, and decorated and embellished by
Perino del Vaga, a&nbsp;pupil of Raphael’s, and a contributor to the
paintings in the Vatican. Perino’s best works here are Jupiter defeating
the Giants, in the principal hall, and the Triumph of Scipio, at the
entrance. In the centre of the garden is a fountain representing Andrea
Doria as Neptune, with his Sea-horses, by P.&nbsp;Carlone. In the
garden, on the other side of the railway, are a colossal statue of
Hercules, erected by Doria, and a monument to the memory of his dog
Rolando, given him by the Emperor Charles, who conferred upon him the
title of “Il Principe.” The tomb of Andrea Doria is in the church of San
Matteo, and over the altar the sword presented to him by
Paul&nbsp;III.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Doria palace is the <a name = "genoa_via_milano" id =
"genoa_via_milano"><b>Via Milano</b></a>, a&nbsp;terraced promenade
lining the western side of the harbour, as the less beautiful but more
costly terrace by the Via Carlo Alberto lines the eastern front. Walking
<i>eastward from the station</i> the first large building is the Royal
Palace, No. 10 Via Balbi. This palace, formerly the property of the
Durazzo family, was erected after the plans of P.&nbsp;F. Cantone and
J.&nbsp;A. Falcone, while the staircases and terraces, which have been
so greatly admired, were by the Chevalier Charles Fontane. The
accommodation is extensive, but the rooms are small, excepting the

<p>The Balbi Palace, No. 4 Via Balbi, built after the plans of
B.&nbsp;Bianco, and improved by P.&nbsp;A. Corradi, contains a large
collection of paintings&mdash;among others a Lucrecia, Cleopatra, and a

<p>No. 1 Via Balbi is the <a name = "genoa_pal_durazzo" id =
"genoa_pal_durazzo"><b>P. Durazzo Pallavicini</b></a>, one of the most
important to visit. The architect was B.&nbsp;Bianco, but the vestibule
and staircases (considered the finest in Genoa) are by
A.&nbsp;Tagliafico. The paintings are almost entirely by Italian
masters, such as Molinaretti, Guercino, Franceschini, Leida, Carracci,
Lanfranco, Procaccini, Cappuccino, Langetti, Castelli, Ferrari,
Vercelli, Reni, Merone, Cogorano, Zanotti, and Merighi. In the first
room there is a valuable triptych by A.&nbsp;Durer, and the gem of the
collection, James&nbsp;I. of England and Family, by Van Dyck. In the
reception room are other three choice works by the same master. The
frescoes on the roofs are by Boni, Piola, Davolio, and Bazzani. In each
room there are cards with the names of the artists and subject.</p>

<p>From the Via Balbi we pass into the <a name = "genoa_annunziata" id =
"genoa_annunziata"><b>Piazza dell’ Annunziata</b></a>, with, on the left
hand, the church of that name, the most sumptuous in Genoa, built in
1228 by the Monaci Umiliati, but altered and left in its present state
by the Conventurati in 1587. The façade, supported on six stately marble
columns, is unfinished. The interior is full of beauty, and resplendent
with glowing colours harmoniously blended. Over the entrance is
Procaccino’s masterpiece, the Last Supper. The frescoes on the cupola
are by A.&nbsp;Ansaldi, those on the choir by J.&nbsp;Benzo, and the
remainder principally by the Carloni. Among the other beautiful things
are the angels supporting an altar, the spiral pillars in the apse, and
the elegant columns of the nave. In front of this church trams start for
Cornigliano, Sestri Ponente, and Pegli every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>We now pass along the Via Nuovissima, and at No. 6 descend to <a name

one piece. Near San Siro, in the confined little square No. 6 Piazza
Pellicceria, is the <b>Palazzo Spinola</b>, with many beautiful
paintings, such as the Martyrdom of St. Barthélemy and St. Laurent by
Ribera, the Four Seasons by Bassano, Virgin and Child by Guercino,

small but valuable collection of pictures by Italian masters,

contains also a good library.</p>

<p>No. 9 Via Garibaldi is the <a name = "genoa_municipio" id =

a&nbsp;splendid building, entirely of marble, and covered with frescoes
representing incidents in the history of Genoa. All the rooms and
galleries are open to the public excepting the council-chamber, the Sala
Rossa, and the Sala Verde. In the first hall (the council-chamber) is a
portrait of Columbus in mosaic, and on the roof a fresco representing
him in the presence of Ferdinand and Isabella. In the second, among
other paintings, is a triptych ascribed to A.&nbsp;Durer, and in the
third (the Sala Verde) a&nbsp;beautiful bust of Columbus. The architect
was Rocco Lugaro, the ornaments and figures over the windows are by
G.&nbsp;T. Carlone, and the frescoes by Pavarone, Paganelli, Passano,
and M.&nbsp;Canzio.</p>

Genoa: Palazzo Serra.</span></p>

<p>At No. 12 Via Nuova is the <a name = "genoa_pal_serra" id =
"genoa_pal_serra"><b>P. Serra</b></a>, built, like most of the other
palaces in this street, about the year 1552, by the celebrated architect
Galeazzo Alessi. The size and distribution of the principal apartments
are excellent, and many are beautifully ornamented in fresco by the
brothers Semini, particularly the ceiling in the first antechamber,
representing the funeral games instituted by Æneas in honour of
Anchises. The dining-room was the work of the famous Genoese architect
Tagliafico, and is greatly admired for its simplicity and good taste.
But the greatest object of attraction in this palace is the grand salon,
shining with gold. Along each side are columns of marble gilt,
alternating with lofty mirrors reaching from the floor to the roof. The
architraves and panels are curiously carved and gilt. The fresco on the
roof is by Leon, and represents the triumph of Spinola over the Turks.
The roof of the next room was painted by A.&nbsp;Semini.</p>

<p>The Palazzo Adorno, No. 8 Via Garibaldi, contains a good though
smaller display of paintings and frescoes. The same may be said of
No.&nbsp;5 in this same street, the <a name = "genoa_pal_spinola" id =

<p>At No. 6 Via Garibaldi is the P. Doria, with a handsome portico and

P.&nbsp;Veronese, Guercino, Murillo, Van Dyck, Domenichino, and
Tintoretto. We now enter the Piazza de Ferrari, with the post office,
the principal theatre, the H.&nbsp;Gènes, and the Accademia delle Belle
Arti, where young men assemble at night to study drawing, painting, and
sculpture. Important trams start from this Piazza. The Staglieno tram
stops at the cemetery; the Carignano tram at the church of
Carignano.</p>

<p>The second street left from the P. de Ferrari leads to <a name =
"genoa_san_matteo" id = "genoa_san_matteo"><b>S. Matteo</b></a>, built
in 1278, but altered in 1530 by G.&nbsp;A. Montorsoli at the request of
Andrea Doria, relating to whose family are the numerous inscriptions on
the church. Over the altar is his sword. The “palaces” in front of the
church belonged to the Doria family.</p>

<p>In the Piazza Nuova is <a name = "genoa_san_ambrogio" id =
"genoa_san_ambrogio"><b>S. Ambrogio</b></a>, entirely covered with
beautiful marbles and adorned in much the same style as the church of
the Annunziata. Among other paintings it contains a large picture of the
Assumption by G.&nbsp;Reni, third chapel right; St. Ignatius healing one
possessed of devils, by Rubens; and over the high altar, by the same
master, the Circumcision. The frescoes in the cupolas are by Carloni and
Galeotto. The large building to the right is the former <a name =
"genoa_pal_ducal" id = "genoa_pal_ducal"><b>Ducal Palace</b></a>, now
the government house. The grand reception room up stairs is ornamented
with 54 columns of Brocatello marble, with bases of Siena marble. From
the windows is seen the tower of the Embriarci, constructed by Guglielmo
Embriarco, the inventor of the movable wooden towers used by Godfrey de
Bouillon in his attacks upon Jerusalem.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Ducal Palace is the <a name =
"genoa_cathedral" id = "genoa_cathedral"><b>Cathedral</b></a>, built in
the 11th cent., but repeatedly restored. The exterior and interior are
of black and white marble in alternate bands. The façade consists of
three large portals resting on spiral, plain, and twisted columns. The
arch of the centre porch has an immense span, bordered by bold fascicled
work, while over the doorway is the Martyrdom of St. Laurence in relief.
In the interior there is a strange mixture of styles. The nave is
separated from the aisles by sombre coloured pillars supporting pointed
arches, over which runs a series of round-headed arches. The roof of the
choir has frescoes by Teverone. The marquetry of the stalls was executed
in the 16th cent. The leading feature, however, in this church is <i>the
chapel of St. John the Baptist</i>, in the centre of the left aisle. It
was built in 1490, and ornamented with statues by G.&nbsp;Porta and
M.&nbsp;Civitali, of which the best are those representing Zacharias in
his official robes, Elizabeth, and Habakkuk. Under a canopy supported by
four porphyry columns is the shrine by D.&nbsp;Terrano (1437), said to
contain the ashes of John the Baptist, brought from Mirra in

1097. At the end of the right or south aisle is the chapel of Mary, with
a Crucifixion by Van Dyck. In the sacristy is preserved a vase once
famous under the name of the Sacro Catino (sacred vessel). It was found
at Cæsarea, in Palestine, and tradition asserted that it had been
presented by the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, and that out of it the
Saviour had eaten the paschal lamb with his disciples. It was believed
to be of emerald; and a law was passed in 1476, declaring that if any
one applied a hard substance to the vase he should suffer death, because
it was suspected that the material was only glass.</p>

<p>Below the cathedral at the foot of the Via S.&nbsp;Lorenzo is a
cab-stand, whence drive by the church of Carignano and the Acqua Sola
Gardens to the Via di Circonvallazione, commanding a series of beautiful
views of Genoa. From the P. de Ferrari an omnibus runs to Carignano,
passing through the Acqua Sola Gardens, 30&nbsp;c.</p>

stair of 249 steps, fee 25 c. each. The omnibus in the square goes to
the Acqua Sola Gardens. From the top of the little wooded hill at the

<p>About 2 m. from Genoa by the western side of the Bisagno is the
<a name = "genoa_campo_santo" id = "genoa_campo_santo"><b>Campo

hour from the Piazza de Ferrari. The greater part of the road runs
parallel to the Genoa aqueduct arches, which follow the sinuosities and
inequalities of the mountain sides for nearly 15 miles.</p>

<p>The front portion of the cemetery is rectangular, 656 ft. wide and
820 ft. long, surrounded by a double arcade of marble arches with a span
of 21 ft., and 18½ ft. high. Each arch can contain seven tiers of three
coffins each, the end space of each narrow cell allowing just room
enough to label the date of the death and the name of the occupant. The
poorest people are buried in the ordinary way, in the ground surrounded
by the arches. The richest have a whole arch to themselves, where all
that money can command in talented sculpture is made to

do service to the feelings of bereaved friends, by perpetuating the
memory of those they have lost, in the choicest and most costly marbles.
These lovely statues appeal more to the sympathy of the spectator than
the medley contents of even a famous sculpture-gallery. Above this rise
other two galleries, and behind the second on the hill side is another
large piece of ground. On a level with the first upper gallery, and
approached by 77 long white marble steps bounded by a massive parapet of
dark greenstone from the quarries of Pegli, is the mortuary chapel,
consisting of a great dome supported on 16 round columns, each of one
block of black marble 32½ ft. high. In eight niches round the interior
are colossal statues of Bible personages, beginning with Eve. The façade
rests on six white marble columns 21 ft. high. The whole vast structure
of galleries, stairs, walls, and floors is arched into cells and vaults
for the dead.

Mediterranean harbour of France. The Royal Dockyard, at the southwest
side of the town, occupies 150 acres; while the artillery magazines, in

<p>“To the N.W. and W. of Spezia is a chain of mountains, of which Monte
Bergamo, 2109 ft., is the most distant. It may be ascended from the
Genoa road, which runs under its N.E. flank. Nearer to Spezia is Monte
Parodi with a carriage-road to the top, whence there is a grand
panoramic view of the surrounding country. Near this is the village of
Biassa, whose inhabitants are supposed to be of Moorish origin. While
the N.W. coast of the Gulf of Spezia is rugged and hilly, the northern
and eastern portion for about three miles is comparatively level, which
renders it a good walking place for invalids. The valleys of the
Migliarini, at the northern extremity of the eastern half of the Spezia
valley, are also excellently adapted for invalids, especially at that
time of the day when the sea-breeze is blowing freshly. A&nbsp;favourite
excursion from Spezia by water is to Lerici and San Terenzo, about
6&nbsp;m. S.E. The steamer sails at noon, and returns at 4. Lerici is in
a most sheltered situation, and remains in sunshine an hour after the

of marble meet the eye. Passing them and crossing the bridge by Walton’s
marble works, walk up the Corso Vittorio Emanuele to the Piazza
Alberica, with a statue of Maria Beatrice and a short arcade. Near the
right side of this piazza are the two hotels. The road to the left leads
up the Carrione to the valley of the stream Torano, and the village of
the same name, ¾ of a mile from Carrara. The valley now becomes
narrower, the road worse, and the heavily laden bullock-carts more

Mount Crestola, and immediately opposite Poggio Silvestro, Polvaccio di
Betogli, and the Mossa del Zampone, from all of which the Romans
procured statuary marble, and which still continue to yield some of the
finest quality. All the quarries (cavé), of which there are 400,
employing 6000 men, are a good way up the face of the mountains. The
ascent to them is over steep slippery marble debris. The nearest and the
easiest “cavé” to visit are on Mt. Crestola. The other quarries are in
the valleys of the Colonnata and of its affluent the Fantiscritti. In
the Fantiscritti mines Roman relics have been found. Any boy will do to
show the way to the rivers Carrione and Torano, and when there it is
impossible to go wrong; but to visit any particular mines a guide is
necessary. Fee 4&nbsp;fr. Besides the common road there is a railway for
the conveyance of marble blocks from the valley of the Torano to the
Marina or Port of Carrara. Many antique Roman statues are of marble from
Carrara, anciently called Luni. The marble of which the Greek statues
are made is from Paros, and from Mount Pentelicon, near Athens. Carrara
is a healthy and busy town, not troubled in the least with mosquitoes in
winter and spring. The great business of the town is the transporting
and dressing of marble; and the principal establishments the studios of
the artists, where statues, monuments, chimney-pieces, and ornaments are
sculptured and exposed for sale. Admission readily granted.</p>

are by Michael Angelo, and are arranged in pairs, each couple opposite
each other being alike, excepting the two at the opposite ends of the
transepts, which, however, are similar in design. One represents the

the Etrurians, but was taken from them by the Ligurians, and colonised
by the Romans about 170 years before the birth of our Lord. The most
remarkable event that distinguished it in ancient times was the
interview which took place here between Cæsar, Pompey, and Crassus, and
which attracted to the town half the senate and nobility of Rome. After
the fall of the Roman empire, Lucca was governed by princes of its own,
from one of whose race, Azon&nbsp;II., of the house of Este, the royal
families of Brunswick and England are descended. The town is in the form
of the letter O, surrounded by ramparts which afford a most agreeable
drive. At the railway end is the Piazza Napoleone, and near it all the
principal sights.

One entire side of the Piazza is occupied by the Palazzo Ducale, now the
Palazzo Provinciale, a&nbsp;vast and substantial edifice, built in 1578,
enclosing two large courts, and containing the prefecture, the
post-office, the picture-gallery, and the government offices. The
<a name = "lucca_gallery" id = "lucca_gallery"><b>Picture-Gallery</b></a>,
open every day (except Mondays), between 10 and 2, although small,
contains some precious works, in handsome halls. In the first room is a
Madonna della Misericordia, and in the second, the Creator with Mary
Magdalene and St. Catherine, both by Fra. Bartolommeo, in 1515 and 1509.
Also pictures by Reni, Zucchero, and Tiziano. In the Sala da Ballo,
painted in fresco by Luigi Adamolli Milanese in 1819, are a Madonna by
Perugini; a&nbsp;full length portrait of Napoleon’s sister Elisa; and
two ancient pictures on wood&mdash;a Nativity, and a Christ with Saints.
The remainder of the pictures are in the rooms which were occupied by
Maria Aloysia Borbonia (Marie Louise), whose monument by Bartolini
(1843) stands in the centre of the square. Leaving the Piazza Napoleone,
by the street at the end of the small avenue, we come to another open
space containing San Giovanni and the Duomo, and between the two
churches a house called the “Administrazione del opera della chiesa;”
where, among other things, are preserved <i>La Croce dei Pisani</i>, an
elaborately wrought gilt silver cross, by B.&nbsp;Baroni in 1350, and
the gold lamp, weighing 24 lbs., which formerly hung in front of the
Tempietto in the Duomo. They are shown at any time, but a fr. is

Badagio, who, three years afterwards, as Pope Alexander&nbsp;II.,
blessed the enterprise of the Norman invader of England. The façade,
with its three tiers of columned galleries, was built in 1204, the choir
in 1308, and the triforium in 1400. The sculptures of the portico are
subjects from the life of St. Martin. Over the door on the left is a
Descent from the Cross, by Nicolo di Pisa, 1233.</p>

<p>Loftiness and simplicity, verging on plainness, characterise the
interior of this church, as well as those of all the others in Lucca,
with the exception of San Romano, which is profusely decorated. The
windows are small and filled with modern glass, excepting the three at
the eastern end, which are by P.&nbsp;Ugolino. All the pictures are
covered, excepting on Sundays and feast-days, but the custodian can
always be found in the sacristy, who shows the church for a franc.
Commencing at the first altar, right hand from main entrance, Nativity,
by Passignano; second, Adoration of the Magi, P.&nbsp;Zucchero; third,
Last Supper, Tintoretto; fourth, Crucifixion, Passignano; fifth,
Resurrection. In south transept, west side, is the monument to Pietro da
Noceto, one of the many admirable works by Matteo Civitali, to whose
genius the church owes its best sculpture, which he contributed during a
period of nearly thirty years from 1472. The angels on the altar in the
Chapel del Sagramento, opposite the monument, as well as the whole of
the chaste white marble altar in the Chapel of St. Regulus, adjoining
the sacramental chapel, are by him. On the left side of the high altar
is the altar to “Christo Liberatori,” by G.&nbsp;Bologna, and adjoining,
La Cappella del Santuario, where again we find the beautiful handiwork
of Civitali displayed on the altar and reliquaries on both sides. The
<b>Madonna</b> which forms the reredos of the altar is by Fra
Bartolommeo. This picture and the Madonna by Ghirlandaio (1400), in the
sacristy, are the two gems in the church. Just outside the Cappella del
Santuario is a recumbent figure of <i>Ilaria del Carretto</i> by Jacopo
della Quercia (1444), unfortunately slightly mutilated, yet a beautiful
imitation of the repose of nature transferred to statuary.

In the north aisle is the <a name = "lucca_tempietto" id =

standing apart, in which is preserved the cedar wood crucifix, 8th or
9th cent., said to have been carved by Nicodemus with the assistance of
an angel. The fresco on the left side of the main entrance into the
Duomo represents him cutting it out. This cross is exhibited three times
a year. The embroidery on the red curtain is an exact copy. The figure
of S.&nbsp;Sebastian on the Tempietto, as well as the elegant pulpit

within it, on each side, are frescoes by Ghirlandaio. To the right is an
ancient circular font about 9&nbsp;feet in diameter, beautifully carved
in relief by Magister Robertus in 1151. The font at present used is
against the wall, and is by N.&nbsp;Civitali, the nephew of Matteo. The
second chapel on the right contains the tomb of St. Zeta, the patroness
of Lucca, in a sarcophagus on the altar. Third chapel beyond this (east
side) is a coronation of the Virgin by Francia, and on the opposite wall
of the same chapel a curious old carving in relief, representing the
assumption of the Virgin. On the opposite side of the church is a chapel
covered with ancient frescoes by Aspertino, one of which represents the
transporting to the church of the cross made by Nicodemus after it had
been found in the sea. By the side of it is St. Augustine being baptised
by St. Ambrosius at Milan; and above them, in the semicircle, an
entombment. Opposite is S.&nbsp;Frediano (who was an Irishman) staying
by prayer an encroachment of the sea, and an Adoration of the Magi.
Above is St. Ambrosius instructing his disciples. On the ceiling, God

The road ascends by the left bank of the river Serchio, through pleasing
scenery, passing the town of Muriano, situated on the right side of the
river. About 13 miles from Lucca is the curious bridge of the Maddalena,
consisting of four arches, the arch next the village of Borgo being
disproportionately large, and with a gradient from the bank to the
centre of 60°. It is only 4&nbsp;feet wide, and, although built in 1322,
is the only bridge across the Serchio that withstood uninjured the great
flood of 1836, when the Serchio attained in three hours a height till
then unknown, and swept away with irresistible fury all the other
bridges, and broke up the mounds, dikes, and embankments. The two
villages (pop. 9500) which go under the name of the Baths of Lucca are
<i>Il Serraglio</i> on the left bank, and <i>Corsena</i> on the right
bank of the Lima, near its junction with the Serchio. On the hill behind
Corsena are the springs and bathing establishments. By the side of the
Lima is the Bagno Cardinali, close to the Casino; and about 100 feet
above the Cardinali is the Bagno Bernabó. A&nbsp;short way westward,
overlooking the valley of the Lima, is the Bagno Doccebasse, and
immediately below it the Bagno dello Spedale-Demidoff, for the exclusive
use of the poor. On the top of the hill, among some houses, is the Bagno
Caldo, and a little to the east, standing by itself, the Bagno San
Giovanni. <i>Hotels:</i> the best are Pagnini’s Hotel and Pension, next
the Casino; and the America, nearer the bridge. On the opposite side of
the river, in Il Serraglio,

are the New York, and the Corona, plainer houses. A&nbsp;mile up the
river by the right bank, along a beautiful road, the Strada Elisa, is
another village, which is also included in the Baths of Lucca, the
<b>Bagno alla Villa,</b> the most beautifully situated of the three.
<i>Hotels:</i> At the entrance of the village, the H.&nbsp;and

establishment is situated, the H.&nbsp;and P. du Pavilion and the

The bathing establishments are fitted up with every modern appliance.
The baths are rather small. Chemically the different springs are very
similar, but in temperature they vary; the coolest is the Doccebasse,
85° Fahr., and the hottest the Bagno Caldo, 133° Fahr. The principal
ingredients are sulphates and carbonates of lime, chlorides of soda and
magnesia, and carbonate of iron. The total amount of saline matter being
15 grs. to the pint. On a tablet at the entrance to the baths of La
Villa is inscribed a list of the diseases cured by the water; but their
principal action is on the digestive organs, and through them
sympathetically on the whole animal economy. Besides, a&nbsp;great deal
of the beneficial effect said to be produced by the water ought with
more reason to be ascribed to the delightful mountain air, and the
charming walks, drives, and rides, which entice visitors to spend the
greater part of the day in healthy rambles. The surrounding country is
beautiful&mdash;steep mountains covered with vines, chestnuts and oaks
rise on each side of the river; while well-made paths and roads wend
their way up through these vineyards and forests to multitudes of points
of various heights, commanding charming views. Season, May to

The altar of the chapel, to the right of the high altar, is of solid
silver. It is generally covered, but by applying at the sacristy a man
will uncover it for 2&nbsp;fr. It remained unfinished for more than 150
years (1314-1466), and is said to be the finest piece of silversmith’s
work of that time in Italy, and that 416 lbs. of silver were employed in
its execution. Below the chancel is a crypt. Fronting the Duomo is the

and white marble, each corner terminating in a pinnacle. The font is
quadrangular, of panelled marbles, and constructed in the 13th cent.
Outside, near the door, is a beautiful stone pulpit. Adjoining is the
Palazzo del Podestá (now the seat of the Tribunale Civile), constructed
in 1367, and restored in 1864. The vaults and soffits of the massive
arches are covered with the armorial bearings of the former mayors of
the town; while, to the left of the entrance, are still the stone-seats
and tables where they sat in judgment.

interior a precious marble pulpit, sculptured by Giovanni da Pisa,
1298-1301. The beadle, for a trifle, illuminates this piece of elaborate
sculpture, when it is seen to still greater advantage. Between the two
last churches is <i>S.&nbsp;Filippo da Neri</i>, with such a quantity of
frescoes, representing angels and saints in glory, that even the visitor
on entering feels himself among clouds also. In the Piazza Prato is
S.&nbsp;Francesco, with some good frescoes and altar pieces. In the
centre of the nave is the tomb of an Englishman, Thomas de Weston,
Doctor Legum, 1408. The word pistol is said to be derived from the name
of this town, as they have been manufactured here from a very early

Best painting by Cimabue, a&nbsp;Madonna, executed in 1240, in the
<a href = "#sta_maria_rucellai">Rucellai chapel</a> of S.&nbsp;Maria

frescoes of A. del Sarto in the <a href = "#annunziata_narthex">narthex

of Florence is from the top of the dome; the ascent is very easy. The
pleasantest drive, with views, is to the Piazza Michel Angiolo, by the
Porta Romana and the Boulevards Machiavelli, Galileo, and Michel Angiolo
(<a href = "#florence_piaz_michelangiolo">page 249</a>), studded with
handsome villas.</p>

Florence: Piazza della Signoria. Loggia dell’ Orcagna.</span></p>

<p>At Florence the Arno is crossed by six bridges. One of these, the
<i>Ponte Vecchio</i>, differs from all the rest in having shops on each
side. By referring to the plan it will be observed that the road to the
Pitti Palace with the Boboli gardens, commences at the south end of this
bridge; while, at the northern end, commences the Via Por S.&nbsp;Maria,
leading to the <a name = "florence_piazza_signoria" id =
"florence_piazza_signoria"><b>Piazza della Signoria</b></a>. From the
north-west corner of the Piazza della Signoria a fine broad street, the
Via Calzaioli, leads to the <i>Piazza del Duomo</i>; from the eastern
corner the street called the Borgo de’ Greci leads into the <a name =
"florence_piazza_sta_croce" id = "florence_piazza_sta_croce"><b>Piazza
Santa Croce</b></a>. It is of great importance to understand the
relative position of these three squares. The chief feature of the
Piazza della Signoria is the <a href =
"#florence_pal_vecchio"><i>Palazzo Vecchio</i></a>, a&nbsp;fine specimen
of the Florentine castles of the Middle Ages (page 274). On either side
of the main entrance are the terminal statues of Baucis and Philemon, by
Bandinelli, and in front the colossal group of Hercules and Cacus, also
by him. Opposite is the spacious Gothic arcade called the <a name =
"florence_loggia_orcagna" id = "florence_loggia_orcagna"><b>Loggia dell’
Orcagna</b></a>, from the name of the architect, or dei Lanzi, from the
name of the watchman who formerly guarded the building. It was usual in
the early period of the Republic to provide a space near the
government-house where the people
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236" id = "page236"> </a>
<!-- png 289 -->
could meet and take part in public affairs; and for this purpose this
open gallery was built opposite the Palazzo Vecchio about the year 1376.
Five steps, running along the front, lead up to the platform, covered by
a vaulted roof, supported on four arches, resting on three columns
terminating in beautiful capitals of the Corinthian order. Two shaggy
lions, in Cipollino marble, ornament the entrance. The lion on the left
is by F.&nbsp;Vacca, 17th cent.; the other, on the right, as well as the
six statues of Sabine priestesses, along the inner wall, beautiful in
attitude and drapery, are antiques, and were brought from the Villa
Medici in Rome in 1788. In front, under each arch, stand three separate
groups, by celebrated masters of the 16th cent. To the right is the Rape
of the Sabines, by G.&nbsp;Bologna, in 1583. Originally this group was
intended to represent Youth, Manhood, and Old Age. To the left the
statue in bronze of Perseus, with the head of the sorceress Medusa, by
B.&nbsp;Cellini. The posture is fine, and full of power and animation,
but the head and body of the Medusa are represented streaming with blood
with a revolting exaggeration. Also left, Judith and Holofernes in
bronze, by Donatello. Behind Perseus is the Rape of Polixena,
a&nbsp;marble group, by Pio Fedi, in 1864. In the centre is an antique
group supposed to represent Ajax dragging the body of
Patrocles&mdash;restored by S.&nbsp;Ricci. Next it is the marble group,
by G.&nbsp;Bologna, representing Hercules slaying the Centaur. In this
Piazza is also the Fountain of Neptune, by Ammanati (pupil of
Bandinelli), 1571. It is crowded with nymphs and satyrs, presided over
by a statue of Neptune (19½ feet high) in a car drawn by four horses.
Adjoining is a superb equestrian statue of Cosmo, by Bologna. The horse
is admirable. To the left of the statue is the Palazzo Uguccione
(considered to have been designed by Raphael), built in 1551. Adjoining
the Loggia dei Lanzi are the extensive buildings “degli Uffizi,” the
great storehouse of art treasures. On both sides of the Piazza, along
the basement floor, extends a wide and lofty colonnade, by Vasari
(1560-74), ornamented with 24 statues of the most eminent Italians. On
the same side as the Loggia is the Post-Office (Reale Poste).
<span class = "headnote float"><a name = "florence_national_library" id

Florence: National Library.</a></span>
On the opposite side, at the second door from the end, is the entrance
to the Galleria degli Uffizi, and six doors farther down, the entrance
to the <i>Biblioteca Nazionale</i>, with about 250,000 vols. and 14,000
MSS. Open from 9 to 4. Any book may be had for consultation in the
reading-room by writing the name on a slip of paper. The National
Library was formed in 1864 by the union of the Palatine Library
collected by the Medici with the Magliabecchian Library collected by
Antonio Magliabechi in 1700. The arch at the S. end of the colonnade
leads to the river Arno and the Ponte Vecchio.</p>

<p>Open daily from 10 to 3. Fee, 1 fr. each. Sundays, free. W.C.’s near
the portrait rooms; key with the keepers in the corner of the southern
gallery. In the top storey of the Uffizi buildings is the famous
collection of paintings, statues, and antiquities, united with a similar
collection in the Pitti Palace, by long galleries which cross the Arno
by the Ponte Vecchio, and extend along the street Via Guicciardini, by
the tops of the houses. The payment of a franc admits to both
collections, and the visitor may commence at either end; either from the
second door left hand, under the Uffizi colonnade, or from the door at
the N.E. corner of the Pitti Palace, next to the iron gate opening into
the Boboli gardens. But the easiest plan is to commence with the Uffizi,
and to descend towards the Pitti gallery by the stair at the top of the
western gallery. The only part of the way in which it is possible to go
wrong, is where (after having passed through the gallery of birds,
fishes, and plants, admirably drawn in 1695 by Bart. Legozzi, and a
small room with a few beautiful miniature paintings representing scenes
in the life of our Lord,) we come to a common stone staircase, which, to
enter the Pitti galleries, <i>ascend</i>, but to go out, descend.
Downstairs, outside, are the Piazza Pitti and the entrance to the Boboli
gardens.</p>

<p>Entering the Uffizi by the second doorway under the colonnade, those
who wish to save themselves the fatigue of the 126 steps up to the
galleries may, for a franc, be carried up in a lift. In the first
vestibule are Roman statues and bas-reliefs representing festivals and
sacrifices, and busts of Lorenzo the Magnificent, Cosmo&nbsp;I.,
Francis&nbsp;I., and of others of the Medici. Second vestibule, more
Roman statuary, and an inimitable Greek figure of a wild boar; the whole
expressing admirably the growling ire kindling in an irritated animal.
Two exquisite wolf-dogs, bold, spirited, and true to nature. The horse,
said to have belonged to the Niobes group, does not bear close
examination.</p>

<p><a name = "uffizi_corridors" id = "uffizi_corridors">We now enter the
eastern corridor</a>, 178 yards long, with the ceiling painted in
arabesques by Poccetti. Ranged on both sides are valuable specimens of
ancient statuary, and of Roman busts of emperors and members of the
imperial family, Augusti et Augustæ. On the walls is hung a valuable and
interesting series of pictures, beginning with the stiff gilded
Byzantine style of the infancy of the art, as No. 1, a&nbsp;Madonna by
Andrea Rico di Candia (1102), and advancing gradually by No. 2, St.
Cecilia, by Cimabue, 130 years later. A&nbsp;marked improvement in

with the statue of the Apollino, were brought from the Villa Hadrian, in
Tivoli, during the reign of Cosmo&nbsp;III. The group of the Wrestlers,
exquisitely finished, wants animation. The Dancing Fawn, attributed to
Praxiteles, is one of the most exquisite works of art that remains of
the ancients. The head and arms were restored by Michael Angelo. In the
<i>Knife-Grinder</i>, the bony square form, the squalid countenance, and
the short neglected hair, express admirably the character of a slave,
still more plainly written on his coarse hard hands and wrinkled brow.
Among the paintings, six are by Raphael&mdash;all gems. 1120 Portrait of
a Lady, painted when he was 20; 1123 the Fornarina, every hue as perfect
as if transferred to the canvas by the sun&mdash;the expression is pert;
1125, the Madonna del Pozzo (Well), attributed also to Franciabigio,
beautifully finished; 1127 St. John in the Desert, colouring tawny, but
admirable light and shade; 1129 the Madonna del Cardellino
(nightingale), one of Raphael’s best works, painted when he was 22; 1131
Portrait of Julius&nbsp;II., considered one of the finest portraits in
the world. In the Hall of Saturn, in the Pitti Gallery, and in the
National Gallery of London, are likewise portraits by Raphael of this
impetuous and warlike pope. 1139 Holy Family by Michael Angelo. This
picture, one of the few by him in oil, exhibits powerful drawing with
dexterous execution. 1112 the Madonna between St. Francis and St. John,
called also the Madonna delle Arpie, by Andrea del Sarto&mdash;rich but
subdued colouring, very pleasing to the eye. 1117 the famous recumbent
Venus, by Tiziano. 1118 the Rest in Egypt, by Correggio&mdash;wonderful
colouring.</p>

round the cold, flat, white wall of an oblong saloon, each on his
separate pedestal, the illusion of design and composition is not only
destroyed but individual criticism invited, a&nbsp;test all of them
cannot bear. It is believed that originally they formed a group on the
pediment of a temple. Niobe is rather large, nearly nine heads high, but
the child she protects is without a fault in form. This group is of one
piece of marble. All the others are in single figures. But the soul and
source of all that is interesting in these statues is the wonderful
figure of the wounded and dying youth, represented lying on his back,
his legs just crossing each other, the left hand reclining on his
breast, and his right arm slightly raised. As a statue, it commands the
highest admiration, and as a chaste and powerful picture of death, the
keenest sympathy. Behind the statue of Niobe is a very large picture by
Rubens&mdash;Henri IV. at the battle of Ivry&mdash;a performance of
wonderful spirit, but unfinished; and opposite it, 147 The entry of
Henri IV. into Paris; 144 Van Dyck, a&nbsp;portrait; 152 Honthorst,
Fortune-teller.</p>

The Connecting Galleries.</a></h5>

<p>Between the Uffizi and Pitti Galleries is a series of passages and
stairs finished in 1564, and opened on the occasion of the marriage of
Francesco de’ Medici with Joanna of Austria, of whom the statue of
“Abundance” in the Boboli gardens is supposed to be a likeness. The
walls of the stairs and corridors on the Uffizi side of the Arno are
covered with a rich and valuable collection of engravings, constituting
a complete history of the art from the 15th cent. to the present time.
The corridor on the <b>Ponte Vecchio</b> crossing the Arno is occupied
with a glorious collection of drawings by the great masters. The first
part of the corridor on the south side of the Arno contains numerous
portraits of the Medicean family, and then follows (on the long passage
behind the Via Guicciardini) a&nbsp;vast collection of tapestry,
executed in the 16th and 17th cent. in Paris and Florence. The best are
those representing the festivities at the marriages of Henry&nbsp;II.
with Catherine de’ Medici, and of Henry IV. with Maria de’ Medici,
executed in 1560 after designs by Orlay. From the tapestry gallery a
short stair ascends to a room hung with pictures painted in chiaroscuro,
or in one colour, by several of the old painters. From this another
short stair leads to the long narrow gallery on the wall of the Boboli
gardens. This gallery is hung with water-colour drawings, by Bartolommeo
Ligozzi, in 1695, representing with wonderful truthfulness, figures of
birds, fishes, and plants. To these illustrations of natural history
succeeds a series of miniature paintings of scenes in the life of our
Lord. Now we come to the common stone stair leading upwards to the Pitti
Gallery, and downwards to the door fronting the Piazza Pitti, and next
the gate leading into the Boboli gardens. At the top of the stair is a
large vestibule, with a window looking into the gardens. The names of
the Sale and Stanze (Halls and Rooms) are on the catalogues. Each room
is provided with two of these catalogues, one in Italian and another in
French. The halls are painted in fresco, and adorned with statuary and
rich tables of Florentine mosaic.</p>

<p>Now either return to the Uffizi by the very long galleries or descend
to the foot of the stairs, and when outside, turn to the left and pass
through the gate leading into the Boboli Gardens, open on Thursdays and
feast-days. Permission to enter on other days is easily obtained at the
office of the Minestero della Casa, under the south corner of the
corridor. The gardens are laid out in a stiff style. Clumps of oleanders
and oleasters among ilexes, laurels, pines, yews, and cypresses,
encircled by tall myrtle hedges, make the grounds in many parts more
like a labyrinth than a garden. Near the entrance is an artificial
grotto, with, in front, a&nbsp;group by&nbsp;V. Rossi, and a Venus by
G.&nbsp;Bologna; and in the four corners unfinished statues by Michael
Angelo, intended for the monument of Julius&nbsp;II. at Rome, and
presented to Cosmo&nbsp;I. by L.&nbsp;Buonarotti. Opposite the palace is
the Amphitheatre; within the centre a granite obelisk and a large
granite basin from Egypt, but brought to Florence from Rome. Beyond the
palace, near the Porta Romana, is the Piazzale del Lago, with groups in
marble by G.&nbsp;Bologna. In the flower-garden “del Cavaliere,” are two
more fountains, with monkeys in bronze, by the same artist, and a small
villa, from the top of which there is a fine view (entrance 25c.) On the
highest part of the gardens, facing the palace, is a colossal statue of
Dovizia (Abundance), commenced by Bologna, and finished by his pupil
Dacca.</p>

not till quite recently was this vast pile finished. The façade is 659
feet in length, 148 feet in height, and the total surface occupied by
the building 35,231 yards. Bart. Ammanati added the wings, and enclosed
the beautiful court opposite the middle entrance with Doric, Ionic, and

there is a cab stand, which is likewise the starting-place of the

<p>There is no place about Florence which affords such an agreeable walk
or drive as to the Piazzale Michelangiolo and the church of
S.&nbsp;Miniato. They are situated on a hill on the left bank of the
Arno, two bridges higher up the river than the Uffizi, and are
distinctly seen from the Lung’ Arno. The nearest way to approach them on
foot is, having crossed the Ponte alle Grazie (the first bridge above
the Ponte Vecchio), walk up the left bank of the Arno, passing the
Piazza containing the fine marble monument to Prince Nicholas Demidoff,
by L.&nbsp;Bartolini, in 1835, and continue the walk up the river till
arrival at a square tower in the Piazza della Molina, whence commence
the ascent by the stairs and road the Viale dei Colli. Or approach it
from the Porta Romana by the fine avenues the Viali Machiavelli and
Galileo, bordered by trees and handsome villas, disclosing as they wind
round the steep sides of the hills a succession of ever-varying views.
The Piazzale Michelangiolo is a splendid terrace, 165 feet above the
Arno, commanding a grand prospect, and adorned with five statues in
bronze, copies by C.&nbsp;Papi of Michael Angelo’s famous works. To the
right is the Viale Michelangiolo, the carriage road leading down to the
Barriera San Niccolo, opposite the suspension-bridge (Ponte Sospenso).
Above the Piazzale, by the convent church of San Salvatore del Monte
(built in 1504 by Cronaca), is the <a name = "florence_san_miniato" id =
"florence_san_miniato"><b>Basilica of San Miniato</b></a>, one of the
earliest (1013) as well as one of the most perfect structures in the
Byzantine style. Internally it is 165 feet long by 70 wide, and is
divided longitudinally into aisles by pillars of classical design. The
façade is faulty. The tower was erected in 1519. The floor of the nave
is considerably under the level of the chancel, which terminates in a
semi-dome, covered with mosaics executed in 1247, and of the same kind
as those of St. Mark’s at Venice. Behind the altar are five small
windows of thin slabs of Pavonazzo marble. Between the stairs leading up
to the chancel is the chapel constructed in 1448 by Michelozzi. Here lie
the remains of Gualberto, the founder of the church and of the order of
Vallombrosa. In the centre of the north aisle is the chapel of Cardinal
Ximenes (died 1459). The monument is by B.&nbsp;Rossellino, and the
beautiful terra-cottas on the ceiling by Luca della Robbia. On the south
side is the Sacristy (built in 1387), exquisitely painted in fresco by
Spinello Aretino, representing scenes in the life of St. Benedict. In

the centre of the nave is a curious piece of Byzantine pavement,
executed in 1207. Below the chancel is the crypt, supported on 38 marble
columns, several being prolongations of those above. Under the altar is
the tomb of San Miniato. From the terraces of the adjoining cemetery
there are splendid views of Florence and of the valley of the Arno.</p>

will be observed that a very short way north from the Pitti Palace are
two churches, the Santa Maria del Carmine, containing the famous
frescoes of Masaccio (b.&nbsp;1402, d.&nbsp;1429), and of Filippino
Lippi (b.&nbsp;1457, d.&nbsp;1504), and the church of Santo Spirito, in
which Luther preached as an Augustinian friar when on his way to Rome.
The present church of the S.&nbsp;Spirito was commenced in 1446 by
F.&nbsp;Brunelleschi, destroyed by fire in 1470, and rebuilt in 1488
according to Brunelleschi’s design. The belfry, which is of admirable
proportions, was erected by B. d’Agnolo. The church is 315 ft. long, and
191 at the transept, and is placed from south to north. The arches of
the aisles rest on 47 pilasters and 35 columns, each of one piece of
pietra-serena, brought from the quarries of Fiesole. Around the church
are 38 semicircular chapels, ornamented with pictures by Alessandro
Allori, Fra. Bartolommeo, Sandro Botticelli, Franciabigio, Raff. del
Garbio, Rodolfo Ghirlandaio, Giotto, Filippino Lippi, Ant. Pollaiolo,
and Cosimo Rosselli. Among the best of these are, in the choir, 12th
chapel from entrance to church, a&nbsp;Madonna by Lippi. In left
transept, 19th and 20th chapels, Martyrs, and The Adulteress, by Allori.
22d chapel, an Annunciation, by Botticelli. Among the sculptures the
most remarkable work is in the 2d chapel, right hand on entering,
a&nbsp;Pieta, by Baccio Bigio, a&nbsp;copy of the group by Michael
Angelo in St. Peter’s, Rome. The proportions of the dead body of our
Lord are admirable, and the ribs, loins, and pectoral muscles skilfully
marked. Before the choir is a screen erected in 1599, composed of bronze
and rich marbles, and although rather out of place, full of beautiful
details.

<a name = "florence_brancacci" id = "florence_brancacci"><b>Brancacci

with valuable frescoes, in 12 compartments, by Masaccio, Lippi, and
Masolino da Panicale. The four principal subjects are (left wall)
“Christ directing St. Peter to take a coin from a fish’s mouth to pay
the tribute,” by Masaccio, whose portrait is given in the last apostle
to the right; “the Restoration to Life of the Emperor’s Nephew,” painted
by Filippino Lippi and Masaccio. On the right wall are&mdash; “St. Peter
raising Tabitha,” by Masolino; “the Crucifixion of St. Peter;” and “St.
Paul before the Proconsul,” by Filippino Lippi. These frescoes are said
to have been studied by Perugino, Raffaelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and
Michael Angelo. Of the eight small subjects, “The Expulsion of Adam and
Eve,” and “St. Peter and St. John Healing the Sick by means of their
Shadows,” on the left wall; “St. Peter Baptising,” and “St. Peter
Distributing Alms,” on the right wall, are all by Masaccio. “The Visit
of St. Paul to St. Peter in Prison,” on the left wall, and “the
Deliverance of St. Peter from Prison,” on the right wall, are by Lippi.
“Adam and Eve under the Tree of Knowledge,” and “St. Peter Healing the
Cripple,” are ascribed by some to Masolino, by others to Masaccio. In
the opposite arm of the transept is the Corsini chapel, with large
marble alti-relievi by Foggini, and frescoes on the ceiling by Luca
Giordano. In a chapel in the sacristy are some frescoes discovered in
1858, attributed to Spinello Aretino, but also, and with more
probability, to Agnolo Gaddi, representing scenes in the life of St.
Cecilia. The old church contained frescoes by Giotto, some fragments of
which, removed the year before the fire, are now in the Royal
Institution, Liverpool.</p>

the 8th of September 1298, under the auspices of the first papal legate
ever sent to Florence, Cardinal Pietro Valeriani. Arnolfo died in 1310.
In 1330 Giotto was appointed master-builder, who, assisted by Andrea
Pisano, continued the work according to Arnolfo’s design. Giotto died in
1337. To Giotto succeeded Francisco Talenti, Taddeo Gaddi, and Andrea
Orcagna. In 1421 Filippo Brunelleschi commenced the <a name =
"florence_cathedral_dome" id = "florence_cathedral_dome">dome</a>, and
completed it in all its essential parts before his death, which took
place in 1446. In 1469 Andrea Verrochio added to the dome the copper
ball and cross. The dome, built without timber centrings, consists of
two vast vaults, an interior and an exterior, both supported by strong
ribs at the right angles, and surrounded at the base by a strong iron
chain. From the floor to the top of the dome the height is 300 feet, the
lantern 52 more, and to the top of the cross other 35. The total height
therefore is, from the floor to the top of the cross, 387 feet. The
circumference of the dome is 466 feet. Three galleries are carried round
the drum. The first is reached by 153 steps; the next by 62 steps more;
and the third, which runs round the top of the drum and the base of the
dome, by other 65 steps. The appearance of the church from the first and
third galleries is most striking. Outside the third gallery commences
the cornice gallery of the dome. From this part 180 steps (between the
two vaults) lead to the top of the cupola. From the top of the cupola to
the ball the <a name = "florence_cathedral_ascent" id =
"florence_cathedral_ascent">ascent</a> is made up through the lantern by
32 vertical bronze steps, and 13 steps in marble, and 23 in wood. The
number of steps, therefore, from the floor into the ball is 528; the
only difficult part being the vertical bronze bear-like ladder in the
lantern, which is not worth ascending, as little can be seen (and that
little with difficulty) from an aperture in the ball. But the view from
the gallery at the top of the dome is truly magnificent. Florence and
neighbourhood lie stretched out below like on a map, and as the
clearness of the Italian air admits of the smallest objects being seen
distinctly, the traveller should visit this gallery as early as
possible, to gain, by the assistance of the plan (<a href =

topography of the city. To the N.E., by the Piazza Cavour and the stream
Mugnone, is Fiesole, 3&nbsp;miles distant, on an eminence (see <a href =

in south sacristy.</p>

<p>The length of the cathedral is 556 feet, and of the transept 342
feet. The breadth, including the aisles, is 132½ feet, and the
superficial area 84,802 feet, or about 6000 feet less than the area
occupied by Cologne cathedral. In 1860 Victor Emmanuel laid the
foundation-stone of the gorgeous new façade, coated, like the whole
exterior of the church, with polished white marble, and dark magnesian
serpentine disposed in chastely ornamented panelling, an arrangement
often met with in the churches of Italy.</p>

<p>In the interior, four arches of enormous span run down each side of
the nave to the choir, which expands with unrivalled majesty under the
magnificent dome. Walk in and behold its beautiful proportions. Do not
struggle to perceive by means of the dim light the few relatively
unimportant statues and pictures, or the intricate designs on the marble
pavement by Agnolo, San Gallo, and Michael Angelo, but go at once and
stand below the second greatest dome in the world, shaped like the
narrow end of an egg, or more correctly, in the form of an elongated
octagonal elipsoid, resting on six massive piers ornamented with statues
of eight of the apostles, by Bandini, Donatello, Bandinelli, and
Sansovini. The octagonal balustrade is by Baccio d’Agnolo, and the
reliefs on the panels by Bandinelli. The fresco on the roof represents
the Judgment Day. The upper portion is by G.&nbsp;Vasari, in 1572, and
the rest by Federigo Zucchero, known in England by his portraits of
Queen Elizabeth. The drum of the dome is lighted by seven circular
windows, which, as well as the three over the main entrance, and the
twenty-seven long windows in the choir, were the work of Domenico Livi
da Gambassi, Bernardo de’ Vetri, and others, from 1434 to 1460. Behind
the altar is the last work of Michael Angelo (when eighty-one years of
age), an <i>unfinished Pieta</i>, a&nbsp;heroic group, large but not
colossal, composed of four figures, those of our Saviour, the Virgin
Mary, Joseph, and an Angel. The interest of the piece lies in the
melancholy but placid countenance of the Redeemer, and the inclination
of the head lacerated by the crown of thorns.

Dante (holding in his hands a copy of his poems), with a view of
Florence in the background, the only monument the Republic raised to him
they had so unjustly banished. In the north transept, covered by the
wooden floor, just under the iron bar, is the gnomen and meridian line,
formed by P.&nbsp;Toscanelli in 1408, and repaired by A.&nbsp;Ximines in
1756. The line drawn on the true pavement, under the present boarded
floor, runs in a direction nearly at right angles to the nave (the nave
being nearly east and west). It is only about 30 feet long, and receives
the image of the sun, at and near the solstice, in June and July; at
other seasons the image is lost on the sides of the cupola. The short
diameter of the image in July is about 36 inches. The height of the
aperture, through which the ray enters by a window of the cupolina, is
277 feet 4 inches, 9.68 lines French measure; so that, as the
inscription states, it is the greatest gnomen existing.</p>

a&nbsp;captain in the army of the Florentine Republic, who died at
Florence in 1394. The mosaic, representing the coronation of the Virgin,
is by Gaddo Gaddi. At the west end of the south aisle is the marble
monument and portrait of Filippo Brunelleschi, by his pupil, And.
Cavalcanti. The third monument from the door is to Giotto, by Majano.
The beautiful water-stoup in front is by Giotto. Opposite the southern
entrance, in front of the Casa dei Canonici, are the statues, in a
sitting posture, of Arnolfo di Cambio and Brunelleschi, by Luigi
Pampaloni, in 1830. To the right of Arnolfo’s statue, at house No. 29,
is a stone in the wall, bearing the words “Sasso di Dante,” because on
it the poet used to sit watching the progress of the cathedral from its
commencement till 1301, when he was compelled to leave the city.</p>

of elegant windows, and terminates in a grand square cornice projecting
from the summit, from which, according to Giotto’s plan, a&nbsp;spire of
94½ feet was to have risen. The niches are peopled with statues of
apostles, saints, and philosophers, and the panels with Scripture

repaired and restored in 1293 by Arnolfo di Cambio. It is an octagonal
building, 94 ft. in diameter, covered by a cupola and lantern built in
1550. <a name = "florence_baptistery_gates" id =
"florence_baptistery_gates">Three celebrated bronze gates</a>, of
admirable workmanship, give access to it. The gate on the S. side
(fronting the Via Calzaioli) was modelled by And. Pisano, and, after
twenty-two years of incessant labour, cast and gilt in 1330. The
architrave, ornamented with foliage, was added by Lor. Ghiberti in 1446,
and the group at the top, representing the Beheading of John, by&nbsp;V.
Danti, in 1571&mdash;a work full of expression. The N. gate is by
Lorenzo Ghiberti, commenced by him when twenty-one, and finished
(modelled and cast) when forty-one, in the year 1424. It is in twenty
compartments, representing scenes from the life of Christ. The three
statues above, and the ornaments, are by Rustici, 1511,
a&nbsp;fellow-pupil of Michael Angelo, and friend of L. da Vinci. At the
eastern end, facing the cathedral, is the bronze gate which Michael
Angelo said was worthy to form the entrance into Paradise. This marvel
of art was commenced by Lorenzo Ghiberti in 1425, cast in 1439, and
finished, with the exception of the lower reliefs, in 1456, when
Ghiberti died, and left the remainder to be completed by his pupils,
among whom were the brothers Pollaioli. It is in ten compartments,
representing as many scenes from the Old Testament. In grouping,
drawing, grace, and beauty, the figures are truly admirable. The
perspective is well sustained; the distant objects being done in low,
the nearer objects in middle, and those close upon the eye in high
relief. Over the gate is the Baptism of Christ, by Sansovino, who, when
he died, in 1529, had finished only the modelling; but Danti, in 1560,
produced it in marble. The Angels, executed nearly a century afterwards,
are by Spinazzi, also from Sansovino’s model.</p>

<p>Nearly in the centre of the Via Calzaioli, between the Piazzas del
Duomo and della Signoria, is the <b>Or San Michele</b>, built at first
of undressed stone, by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1282, for a granary or
horreum. Having been destroyed by fire in 1304, it was rebuilt in 1337
under the direction of Taddeo Gaddi, the chief architect of the
commonwealth. To Gaddi succeeded And. Orcagna, who received orders to
transform the lower part (the loggia) into a church. In 1569 the upper
storey was converted into government offices. Round the building, in
deep niches, are statues in simple attitudes and of noble dignified
forms, the result of a decree that each trade should bear the expense of
furnishing one statue, which should be the protector and supporter of
its own profession. St. Luke, by John of Bologna (good specimen of his
style), was executed at the expense of the lawyers. Our Lord and St.
Thomas, by Verrochio, for the mercantile tribunal. John the Baptist, by
L.&nbsp;Ghiberti, for the guild of foreign wool-merchants. St. Peter, by
Donatello, for the butchers. John the Evangelist, by Montelupo, under a
graceful canopy of Robbia-ware, for the silk manufacturers. St. George,
by Donatello, his noblest work, for the armourers. St. James, by
N.&nbsp;Banco, for the tanners and furriers. St. Mark, by Donatello, for
the flax-dealers. West front, St. Eloy, by Banco, for the blacksmiths
and farriers. St. Stephen, by L.&nbsp;Ghiberti, for the wool-merchants.
St. Matthew, by L.&nbsp;Ghiberti and Michelozzo, for the stockbrokers
and money-changers. Statues of four canonised sculptors, by Banco, for
the builders and carpenters. St. Philip, by Banco, for the hosiers. And
inside the church, to the left of the altar of St. Anne, a&nbsp;Madonna,
by Simone da Fiesola, for the physicians and apothecaries. These statues
are considered the finest works of the ancient Florentine school. Over
the niches are the arms of the respective trades, under graceful
canopies.</p>

<p>In the interior the most remarkable object is the canopied high
altar, by Orcagna, otherwise called Cionis, with Ugolino’s sacred
picture of the Madonna. Inscribed on the altar is “Andreas Cionis pictor
Florentinus hujus oratorii archimagister extitit, 1359.” It is
ornamented with Scripture histories in relief on marble, the different
pieces being fixed together by pins of bronze run in with lead. The
small but beautiful stained glass windows do not admit sufficient light
into the church. Behind San Michele, in the Mercato Nuovo, is an

<p>South-east from the fountain, in the Piazza della Signoria, by the
narrow street the Borgo dei Greci, is the Piazza Santa Croce, with, in
the centre, the fine marble statue of Dante, 16½ feet high, by Enrico
Pazzi. It and the new façade of the church were inaugurated in 1865, on
the 600th anniversary of the birthday of the poet. The church of Santa
Croce was commenced by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1297, to whom succeeded
Giotto in 1344. The façade, although only recently finished, is
according to the old design of S.&nbsp;Pollaiolo (d.&nbsp;1509), and
owes its erection in a very great measure to the liberality of an
English gentleman, the late Francis Sloane, who died at Florence in
1871. The interior is divided into a nave and two aisles by seven acute
Gothic arches. The pilasters, supporting columns as well as the roof,
are of rude work, while the side chapels are not inclosed, but spread
out on the walls of the aisles, an arrangement which greatly favours the
display of the magnificent monuments erected in this church. The entire

Palazzo del Podestà, built in the 13th cent. by Lapo Tedesco and two
Dominican friars, Fra. Sisto and Fra. Ristoro. It bore various names,
according to the functions of the different dignities who occupied it.
When, in the 17th cent., it was converted into a prison and became the
seat of the head of the police, it was called the Bargello. In 1864 it
was chosen for the National Museum. Open from 10 till 3.30, 1&nbsp;fr.
Free on feast-days. The walls of the court are ornamented with the
escutcheons of 204 Podestas (chief magistrates). The rooms on the ground
floor are filled chiefly with armour, among which are a bronze cannon
cast in 1636, and Donatello’s seated lion, the <b>Marzocco</b>, or the
<b>Arms of Florence</b>, a&nbsp;seated lion supporting a shield with its
left paw. Ascend to the first floor by the <i>outside</i> staircase in
the court. It was built by Agnolo Gaddi. At the top, in the vestibule,
are two bells, one cast in 1228 by Bart. Pisano, and the other by Cenni

a&nbsp;plain building, containing a collection of paintings, sculptures,

of the State by the last member of the family, Cosmo Buonarrotti, in
1858. The gallery is open to the public on Mondays and Thursdays, from 9

in seven rooms, some very small. In the centre of the first room is a
small bust of Michael Angelo, and Nos. 1, 2, and 3 portraits of him at
different ages. No. 14, Battle of Hercules, and No. 17, Madonna, both in
relief, by Michael Angelo. Nos. 11, 13, 15, and 16 are glazed
terra-cotta figures by the Robbias, displaying admirably the fine
delicate surface of the enamel peculiar to their productions. Amongst
those who have distinguished themselves in the manufactory of
earthenware is Luca della Robbia, a&nbsp;Florentine goldsmith and
statuary, born in 1388. He made heads and human figures in relief, and
architectural ornaments of glazed earthenware, terra-cotta invetriata.
The colours are white, blue, green, brown, and yellow. The art of making
these glazed earthen figures invented by Luca was taught by him to his
brothers Ottaviano and Agostino, and was afterwards practised by his
nephew Andrea. The rooms to the left contain drawings and plans of
Michael Angelo, many being the original sketches of his greatest works.
First room right, the principal room of all, contains the statue of
Michael Angelo in a sitting posture, by Novelli; and around the room
sixteen pictures illustrating scenes in his life. The lower six are in
grisaille. The ceiling is painted in fresco. The next or fourth room

considered in the earlier periods of the Republic the metropolitan
church of Florence. Its existence is traced as far back as the year 393,
when it was consecrated by St. Ambrose. In 1059 it was rebuilt and
consecrated by Pope Nicholas&nbsp;II. Having been destroyed by fire in
1417, during a festival given by the Guelphs of Arezzo and the Guelphs
of Florence, it was again rebuilt by Brunelleschi and Michael Angelo,
and finished by Antonio Manetti in 1461. It is constructed in the form
of a T, 400 feet long from east to west, and 170 from north to south.
The aisles are lofty, and separated from the nave by 14 Corinthian
columns. The two pulpits are adorned with subjects from Scripture, in
relief, by Donatello and his pupil Bertoldo. The cupola is painted by
Meucci. At the north transept is a monument in white marble by
Thorwaldsen to Pietro Benvenuto, the painter of the cupola of the

with polished marbles and other shining stones, glowing with brilliant
harmony of colour, yet chaste and simple. The splendid hues are
continued on the ceiling under the dome by the masterly frescoes of
P.&nbsp;Benvenuti, painted in 1835. In each of six of the sides is a
monument to a member of the Medicean family, from Cosmo&nbsp;I. to
Cosmo&nbsp;III. (d.&nbsp;1723), whose son, G.&nbsp;Gastone
(d.&nbsp;1736), has his memorial slab behind the altar in the crypt or
lower church downstairs, where repose the remains of Donatello near
those of his patron Cosmo&nbsp;I., as well as those of 35 other members
of this once powerful family, which gave three popes to the Church of
Rome, two queens to France, and reigned 250 years over the sixteen
cities of Tuscany, whose escutcheons in beautiful mosaic are set in
panels round the mortuary chapel, below the granite mausoleums of these
princes. The Cappella dei Principi was designed by G. de Medici, and
built by M.&nbsp;Nigetti in 1604, for Ferdinand&nbsp;I., Duke of
Tuscany, to receive the “great stone” which Joseph of Arimathea rolled
“to the door of the sepulchre” of our Lord; and which had been promised
him by the Emir Focardino, governor of Jerusalem. The Emir not having
fulfilled his promise, Ferdinand adopted the intention of his
predecessor, Cosmo&nbsp;I., and had it converted into the burial chapel
of the Medicean family.

From this chapel a short narrow passage leads to the <b>Sagrestia
Nuova</b>, or the Cappella dei Depositi, containing the monuments and
mortal remains of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, and brother of Pope Leo X.;
and of their nephew Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, and father of Catherine of
Medicis; these two monuments, with the statue of Moses at Rome, are the
greatest works of Michael Angelo. The plan of the edifice was conceived
by Pope Leo, but the design and execution were entrusted in 1521 to
Michael Angelo. The interior is disappointing. A&nbsp;formal square
chapel, with walls partly encrusted with whitish marble, supported by
two tiers of Corinthian pilasters of that cold grey stone called pietra
dura, and pierced with doors and windows arranged in the same tame, flat
style. To the right on entering is the grand monument of Giuliano. He is
represented in a sitting posture, with his left hand gloved and raised.
The bent forefinger touches the upper lip, which seems to yield to the
pressure. The helmet throws a deep shade on the countenance. The two
statues reclining on the urn represent Day and Night. Day is little more
than blocked, yet most magnificent. To have done more would have
weakened the striking effect of the whole, which is
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<a name = "page266" id = "page266"> </a>
<!-- png 320 -->
heightened by what is left to the imagination. Night is finely imagined.
The attitude is beautiful, mournful, and full of the most touching
expression&mdash;the drooping head and the supporting hand are
unrivalled in the arts. Opposite is the monument of the nephew. The
attitude of Lorenzo is marked by such a cast of deep melancholy brooding
as to have acquired for it the title of “il pensiero.” Beneath are the
personifications of Evening and Dawn. Twilight is represented by a
superb manly figure, reclining and looking down; the breadth of chest
and the fine balance of the sunk shoulder are masterly, while the right
limb, which is finished, is incomparable. The Aurora is a female figure
of exquisite proportions. In its serene countenance a spring of thought,
an awakening principle, seems to breathe life into the face of stone, as
if preparing it to open its eyes with the rising day. In front of the
altar is a striking but unfinished Madonna, by Michael Angelo. On the
right is a statue of San Cosmo, by Montorsoli, a&nbsp;pupil of Michael
Angelo’s, and on the left Santo Damiano, by Montelupo.</p>

<p>A door in the middle of the south aisle of the church of
S.&nbsp;Lorenzo leads into the cloister, whence ascend the staircase, by
Vasari, to the <a name = "florence_laurentiana" id =
"florence_laurentiana"><b>Bibliotheca Mediceo-Laurentiana</b></a>. The
books are kept in desks. Open from 9 to 3. Closed on feast-days. Fee,
1&nbsp;fr. This library was founded by Cosmo in 1444. Amongst the
remarkable manuscripts there is one of Virgil of the 4th cent. in Roman
capitals, not very different in form from the letters on ancient Roman
marbles; it is on vellum, of the size of a small quarto, with notes; the
notes written in the 5th cent. by the Consul Turcius Rufus Apronianus,
as his signature attests. This is one of the most ancient legible
manuscript books in Europe of which the period is authentic. The
manuscript of Virgil, in the Vatican library, with paintings, was said
to be of the 4th cent., of the time of Constantine. The manuscripts of
the middle ages, instead of being in Roman capitals, are written in
letters resembling in some degree the small Roman printed letter now in
use; and, at a still later period, they are in a running hand. This
library also possesses the celebrated manuscript of the Pandects,
supposed to be of the time of Justinian, in the 6th cent., written in
capital letters, which vary a little from the capitals on ancient Roman
marbles; it is on vellum, of the size of a large folio book; it was
brought from Pisa, and Cosmo&nbsp;I. caused an edition to be printed
from it by Lelio Torelli. A&nbsp;Tacitus, of the 11th cent. is in a
running letter. The library contains 8000 volumes of manuscripts. Many
of them are chained to the desks.</p>

<p><i>First Room</i>, The vases stand round the room in glass cases. The
earliest are in the first case to the right. Next, case 11, is the
entrance to an Etruscan tomb, which in its main features resembles that
in which our Lord lay. From the frescoes, which are copies of the
original on the tomb near Orvieto, it will be observed that the
Etruscans seem to have treated death as a feast, to which the spirits
were invited by the gods. <i>Second Room</i>, In the centre is the vase
of Peleus, or vase of François, by whom it was discovered in 1845 near
Chiusi. It is supposed to have been modelled by Ergatimos, and painted
by Clitias. <i>Third Room</i>, Minor objects. <i>First Octagon Room</i>,
Beautiful gold ornaments, beads, and glass bowls. Etruscan coins. From
this room a corridor extends to a similar room, in which is a beautiful
bronze statue of Pallas Athene with the ægis, and some fine Etruscan
mirrors. <i>Fourth Room</i>, In the centre stands the Chimæra, one of
the celebrated statues of antiquity. <i>Fifth Room right</i>, Armour.
<i>Sixth Room</i>, Etruscan sculpture. Both of the gems of the
collection are in this room&mdash;<i>The Orator</i>, a&nbsp;bronze
statue above life size, discovered near Lake Thrasymene; and an
<i>Etruscan Sarcophagus</i>, which lay nearly 2000 years buried in the
earth, and is supposed to have been made about 300 years <span class =

inscriptions, into the Egyptian Museum. <i>First Room</i>, In the
centre, a&nbsp;Scythian war-chariot (the only specimen known), and by
the side of it the remains of the Egyptian soldier who probably captured
the chariot in battle. <i>Second Room</i>, The most interesting object
here is the fresco of the <i>Last Supper, by Raphael</i>, in 1505, when
only twenty-two. On the border of St. Thomas’s dress are the date and
name. In the last great hall are sarcophagi, reliefs, statues, obelisks,
idols, mummies, portraits, and tabernacles.</p>

<p>Close to the railway station, and a short way west from the cathedral
and S.&nbsp;Lorenzo, is the church of <a name =

Maria Novella</b></a>, facing the piazza of the same name, adorned with
two large obelisks of Serravezza Mischio marble, crowned with Florentine
lilies in bronze, by G.&nbsp;Bologna, 1608.</p>

<p>This church, standing south and north, was commenced in 1221 and
finished in 1371. The façade was designed by L.&nbsp;Alberti, and
erected at the expense of G.&nbsp;Rucellai, whose name is inscribed on
the frieze, “Joannes Orcellarius, 1470.” Affixed to it are gnomonic
instruments, made by Ignazio Dante in 1573. In the interior, the fresco
over the principal door is after the Lippi school. The crucifix is by a
pupil

remarkable fresco, a&nbsp;Trinity, by Masaccio; opposite is a fresco
attributed to Gaddi. But the most interesting objects are all at the
northern or apsidial end of the church. At the extremity of the east or
right transept, up some steps, is the <a name = "sta_maria_rucellai" id

The walls of the chancel, or recess occupied by the high altar, are
covered with exquisite paintings in fresco by D.&nbsp;Ghirlandaio,
nearly all representing scenes from Scripture. The stalls are by
B.&nbsp;d’Agnola, and the windows by G.&nbsp;Fiorentino. In the chapel
on the left, or west from this, the Cappella Gondi, is the famous wooden

A&nbsp;curtain is before it. At the end of the W. transept, up some
steps, is the Strozzi chapel, with frescoes by A.&nbsp;Orcagna and his
brother Nardo, representing the Day of Judgment, Heaven, and Hell. The
open door at the foot of the steps leads into the sacristy, where,
immediately on one side of the door, is a beautiful terra-cotta basin,
by L.&nbsp;Robbia; and, on the other side, one of marble by
G.&nbsp;Fortini. A&nbsp;large door in the west, or left aisle, opens
into the cloister called the Chiostro Verde, because the frescoes on the
walls, by Paolo Uccello, 1390-1470, and Dello Delli, 1401, are painted
in green. Here the keeper, for a few sous, opens the door leading into
the Cappella degli Spagnuoli, designated thus from having been used by
the attendants of Eleonora de Toledo, wife of Cosmo&nbsp;I. The ceiling
and the left wall are covered with admirably conceived and executed
frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi, while those on the right wall are by Simone
Memmi. Adjoining is the Chiostro Grande, ornamented with 52 frescoes, by
Cigoli, Allori, Tito, Poccetti, and other artists of the 15th and 16th
cent., illustrative of the history of the Dominicans, with views of
Florence in the background.

figures over the columns of the arcade. In the centre of the square is
an equestrian statue of the Grand Duke Ferdinand&nbsp;I., by Bologna, in
1608, and two bronze fountains by Pietro Tacca. The <b>Church of the

Rosselli: Filippo assumes the habit of the Order. In the narthex is also
the tomb of Andrea del Sarto (died 1606), with bust by Caccini.</p>

<p>The design of the interior of the church is by Ant. da S.&nbsp;Gallo.
Gherardo Silvani added the marble decorations. The pictures between the
windows are almost all by C.&nbsp;Ulivelli. On each side of the aisle
are five chapels, and at the termination of the aisle are two short
transepts and a circular tribuna designed by Alberti, covered with a
cupola painted by B.&nbsp;Franceschini and Ulivelli. In the right
transept is the tomb of Bandinelli, with a Pieta by himself. Immediately
behind the high altar, adorned with a ciborium or canopy by
B.&nbsp;Agnolo (1543), is the Cappella del Soccorso, with the tomb of
Gian Bologna (d.&nbsp;1608), who constructed this chapel for himself,
and ornamented it with some of his best works. Under the organ in the
second chapel is an Assumption by Perugino. In the third chapel is a
Crucifixion by Stradano, his best work. In the fourth, a&nbsp;copy of
Michael Angelo’s “Judgment Day,” by Allori. Next it, and to the left of
the main entrance, is the chapel and shrine of the <i>Annunziata</i>,
built in 1445, by Michelozzi, and lighted by forty-one silver lamps and
one gold lamp glittering among costly polished stones. Over the altar is
an Annunciation in fresco by Pietro Cavallini (d.&nbsp;1364), said to
have been done by angels.

the sacristy built by Michelozzi, with statue of Christ by Novelli, and
of S.&nbsp;Antonino by Montorsoli. To the left of the high altar is the
Chapel of the Sacrament, with paintings by Tito, Empoli, Poccetti, and
Passignano. In the left transept is the chapel of S.&nbsp;Antonino, with
frescoes by Passignano in his best style, and a painting by Bronzino.
Between the second and third altars on this the left side of the church,
are the graves of the scholar Pico della Mirandola, d.&nbsp;1494; the
poet Girolano Benivieni, d.&nbsp;1542; and of Poliziano, d.&nbsp;1494,

the south corner of the east wall opens into the chapter-house, with a
large fresco of the Crucifixion by B.&nbsp;Angelico. A&nbsp;very famous
work. The crucifix on the left is by B.&nbsp;Montelupo, and the other by
his son. The door in the middle of the east wall gives access to the
picture-gallery in the upper storey. At the foot of this stair is a
grand picture, a&nbsp;Last Supper (Cenacolo) by Ghirlandaio, who has
dressed the company in the costume of the brotherhood. From this ascend
to the first floor to what were the cells or rooms of the monks, ranged
on each side of a narrow passage ornamented with paintings in fresco. At
the head of the stair is a very beautiful Annunciation by Fra. Angelico,
and also by him, on the opposite wall, a&nbsp;St. Dominic embracing the
Cross. Opposite the Crucifixion is the best of the corridors. The cells
of the right corridor are ornamented with frescoes, principally by Fra.
Benedetto, and those of the left principally by his more famous brother,
Fra. Angelico. Next the staircase we have the library. Second room,
banners used for Dante’s festival in 1865. Next, two frescoes by
Benedetto. In the last two rooms, one a little higher than the other,
Cosmo de’ Medici (Pater Patriæ) used frequently to reside. His portrait
is by Pontormo, “The Jesus of Nazareth” is by Fra. Bartolommeo, and the
beautiful fresco by Angelico. In the cell opposite is a Crucifixion by
Angelico. In the third room, painted on wood by Angelico, are an
“Adoration” and an “Annunciation.” In the fourth, also by him, other two
famous pictures on wood, the <i>Madonna della Stella</i> and the
<i>Coronation of Mary</i>. Turning to the right we find all the cells
(as far as that of Savonarola), with paintings by Fra. Benedetto or some
pupil of Angelico. In the middle of this corridor is the beautiful
Madonna enthroned, an admirable work of B.&nbsp;Angelico. At the end, in
a kind of chapel, are two Madonnas on the wall by Fra. Bartolomeo:
a&nbsp;Virgin in <i>terra invetriata</i>, by L. della Robbia; the bust
of Savonarola, full of expression, modelled by Bastianini; and a sketch
of the bust of Benivieni by Bastianini. In the two little cells at the
side, in which dwelt Savonarola, are preserved some manuscripts,
a&nbsp;crucifix, and other objects which belonged to him; as also his
portrait painted by Fra. Bartolommeo, and a view of the Piazza della
Signoria, with the burning of Savonarola and his companions. Proceeding
along the corridor, in which there are no cells on the right for some
distance, we come to more frescoes by Benedetto, the best being a

The Palaces of Florence.</a></h5>

<p>The palaces of Florence are great square edifices of a grand and
gloomy aspect, built of dark blue stones (pietra forte) measuring from 3
to 4&nbsp;feet. The bases, to the height of from 20 to 30 feet, consist
of coarsely chiselled rubble work, which lessens the baldness, and
contributes character and effect to the from 200 to 300 feet of plain
wall. At intervals are strong bronze banner-rings and torch-sockets,
while at each corner is a curiously-shaped lamp of wrought-iron. Near
the main entrance there is generally a niche, with an opening called a
“cantina,” just large enough to allow a quart bottle to pass through,
whence various articles of food are transmitted into the house. Those
that sell by retail the oil and wine from their estates have painted
over this niche “Vino é Olio.” The empty bottle, with the money, having
been passed through, it reappears shortly after full. The windows of the
first range are generally 10 feet from the ground, and are grated and
barred like those of a prison. Under the eaves runs a deep cornice with
bold projecting soffits. The roofs of the palaces, as well as those of
the smallest houses, are of a low pitch, and covered with tiles of two
different forms&mdash;a flat tile with ledges on the side, and a tile
nearly semi-cylindrical and tapering upwards, which thus covers the
interstice between the ledges of the flat tiles. The entrance to the
palaces is by a high arched massive gateway, giving access to a court
surrounded by
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
<!-- png 328 -->
an arcade or loggia, whence massive stone staircases lead up to the
highest storeys. The lofty ceilings of the principal rooms are
decorated, and the beams though displayed, are carved, painted, and
gilded, and contribute to the grandeur of the whole. The floors are of
thin bricks, either laid flat or edgeways in the herring-bone or
<i>spina di pesce</i> fashion. As in Genoa, several of the palaces
contain collections of works of art open to the public on certain days.
<span class = "headnote float"><a name = "florence_pal_vecchio" id =

Of these the best are&mdash;first, the <b>Palazzo Vecchio</b>, in the
Piazza della Signoria, erected in 1218 by Arnolfo di Lapo. It is
surmounted by a noble antique tower 305 feet high, commanding an
excellent view of Florence. The entrance is through a superb but gloomy
court, surrounded by an arcade on massive columns, by Michelozzi,

circumference, and of admirable proportions. In the centre is a neat
little fountain by Andrea Verocchio, intended originally for the Villa
Careggi. Having traversed this court, ascend first stair left hand, and
keep turning to the left the length of the first storey, where take
first door right, which opens into the great hall or council chamber,
170 feet long by 77 broad, built in 1495, but altered by Vasari in 1540,
who also added the frescoes on the walls and oil-painting on the ceiling
illustrative of events in the history of Florence. Now ascend to the
second storey, where enter the ante-room to the left, the Sala de’
Gigli, with a grand but injured fresco by Ghirlandaio in 1482. The
lintel of the door in this room opening into the next, the Sala
d’Udienza, is by Benedetto da Majano. On one of the leaves of the door
is a linear drawing of Dante, and on the other one of Petrarch. The Sala
d’Udienza is painted in fresco by Salviati, illustrative of Roman
history. It communicates with the Cappella S.&nbsp;Bernardo, beautifully
painted in imitation of mosaic by R.&nbsp;Ghirlandaio. Near the chapel
of St. Bernard (sometimes approached by the four rooms of Eleanora de
Toledo, painted by Stradan of Bruges, and at other times by a narrow
passage), is a small chapel beautifully painted by Bronzino, and an
adjoining chamber painted by Poccetti.</p>

from 11 to 1. It was built in 1489 from designs by Majano. The ironwork,

on the first floor is contained in four large rooms elegantly and
comfortably furnished. In each room there is a list of the paintings on
a card. The two most remarkable are&mdash;<b>Portrait</b> of one of the
ladies Strozzi by Leonardo da Vinci; and another of one of the children,
“La Puttina,” by Tiziano. Between the Strozzi Palace and the Arno is the
Piazza S.&nbsp;Trinità. In it, opposite the Hotel du Nord, is a column
of Oriental granite from the baths of Antoninus, presented to
Cosmo&nbsp;I. by Pius IV. A&nbsp;short way down the Arno (see plan), at

Cosmo Pater Patriae, and continued to be the residence of the Medici
till 1540, when it was abandoned for the Palazzo Vecchio. The first row
of large windows was opened by Michael Angelo; for originally the base,
rising to 30 feet, presented one unbroken space, varied only by the
projection of the vast and rudely chiselled stones of which it is
composed. In the court below the corridor are statues and busts, and the
sarcophagi which were formerly outside the baptistery, and a curtain
beautifully sculptured in stone over one of the arches. Upstairs are the
Biblioteca Riccardi, a&nbsp;picture-gallery, and a small chapel covered
with most charming frescoes by Benozzo Gozzoli 1400-1478, painted by
lamplight, as the chapel at that time had no window. Palace open from
12.30 till&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>Down the Arno, beyond the Ponte alla Carraia (see plan), is the
Church of Ognissanti. In the chapel next the door of the sacristy repose
the remains of Amerigo Vespucci, who gave his name to America. In the
centre of the nave are frescoes by Ghirlandaio and Botticelli. The
frescoes in the cloisters illustrating the life of St. Francis are by

Porta S.&nbsp;Gallo take the road leading up the left or east bank of
the Mugnone for about 1&nbsp;mile, as far as the Villa Palmieri, where,
in 1348, Boccaccio wrote his Decameron. From this the road ascends
between walls about 1&nbsp;mile more to the Church and Convent of
S.&nbsp;Domenico, in which Beato Angelico was one of the monks. The
church contains an Annunciation by Empoli; a&nbsp;Baptism of Christ by
Credi; a&nbsp;St. Francis by Cigoli; and in the choir a Virgin with
Saints by B.&nbsp;Angelico. Near S.&nbsp;Domenico is the Villa Landore,
which was occupied for many years by Walter Savage Landor. The road
striking off to the left or towards the Mugnone, leads to the venerable
abbey of La Badia di Fiesole, rebuilt in 1462 by Brunelleschi. The road
from St. Domenico to Fiesole is rather steep, and passes, at about
two-thirds of the way, the beautiful old mansion with terraced gardens
called the Villa Mozzi or Spence, once a favourite residence of Lorenzo

side of the Piazza is occupied by the Cathedral, dedicated to St.
Romulus, commenced in 1028, and in form resembling S Miniato. To the
right of the high altar is the mausoleum of Bishop Salutati, and a
marble tabernacle by Mino da Fiesole in 1465. The frescoes on the
ceiling of the chancel are by Ferrucci; and the statue of St. Romulus in
a sitting posture by Luca della Robbia or his nephew. In a garden behind
the church are the remains of a Roman theatre. The road passing this
garden leads to the ruins of the ancient walls, formed of huge
uncemented blocks, not parallel, but of different sizes, and some of
them indented into each other. Fronting the Cathedral is the
commencement of a little stony road leading up to the terrace of a
Franciscan convent, commanding a glorious view, and to the church of

<p>Straw-plaiting gives employment to numerous females around Florence.
The wheat used is sown in March, and is cut before the grain is ripe.
The straw is then divided into pieces from 6 to 8 inches long, and
exposed for sale in the markets in small bunches. In this state it is
bought by the plaiters, who in their turn expose for sale yards of
plaited straw to the hatters.</p>

A little beyond Pelago the road to Vallombrosa begins to ascend the

crags. <a name = "vallombrosa" id = "vallombrosa"><i>Vallombrosa</i></a>
is situated 2980 feet above the sea, on the side of Mt. Protomagno,
which rises 2340 feet higher. Although the scenery does not agree
altogether with Milton’s description in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, book iv.
lines 131-159, it possesses that charming loveliness which inspired the
divine poet with the ideas conveyed in these lines. The steep acclivity
is clothed with a “woody theatre” of stateliest chestnuts, oaks, firs,
and beeches, which in ranks ascend, waving one above the other, shade
above shade; or hang from the very brows of precipices, whose verdant
sides are with thicket overgrown, grotesque, and wild. “Higher than
their tops” an occasional glade breaks the uniformity of the sylvan
scene, while on the summit expands a wide grassy down with enamelled
colours mixed, from which there is a “prospect large” over foliaged
hills, and the wild, bleak, sterile mountains of Camaldoli and Alvernia.
The church and convent were erected in 1637. The latter is now occupied
partly by a forestry school and partly by an inn. Nearly 300 feet
higher, by a winding path, is Il Paradisino, a&nbsp;little hermitage
romantically situated on a projecting rock commanding a grand view. The
scagliola decorations in the chapel were by an Englishman, Father
<b>Hugford</b>, who excelled in various branches of natural philosophy,
and in the art of imitating marble by that composition called scagliola.
He died in the last century. The ascent to the summit of the Protomagno
occupies 1 hour; guide 2&nbsp;fr. The road to Camaldoli winds round the
mountain that shelters Vallombrosa on the north side, and then descends
into the Val d’Arno Inferiore. On a knoll, encircled with trees in the
middle of the plain, is the noble now ruined castle of Romena, and
behind it the villages of Poppi and Bibbiena.</p>
