“<i>C. B. Black’s Guide-books have a character of their own; and that
character is a good one. Their author has made himself personally
acquainted with the localities with which he deals in a manner in which
only a man of leisure, a&nbsp;lover of travel, and an intelligent
observer of Continental life could afford to do. He does not ‘get up’
the places as a mere hack guide-book writer is often, by the necessity
of the case, compelled to do. Hence he is able to correct common
mistakes, and to supply information on minute points of much interest
apt to be overlooked by the hurried observer.</i>”</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> Guide-book consists of
<i>Routes</i> which follow the course of the main Railways. To adapt
these Routes as far as possible to the requirements of every one the
Branch Lines are also pointed out, together with the stations from which
the Coaches run, in connection with the trains, to towns distant from
the railway. The description of the places on these branch lines is
printed either in a closer or in a smaller letter than that of the towns
on the main lines.</p>

<p>Each Route has the <i>Map</i> indicated on which it is to be found.
By aid of these maps the traveller can easily discover his exact
situation, and either form new routes for himself, or follow those
given.</p>

<p>The <i>Arrangement</i> of the Routes is such that they may be taken
either from the commencement to the end, or from the end to the
commencement. The Route from Paris to Marseilles, for example, does
equally well for Marseilles to Paris.</p>

<p>The <i>Distance</i> of towns from the place of starting to the
terminus is expressed by the figures which accompany them on each side
of the margin; while the distance of any two towns on the same route
from each other is found by subtracting their marginal figures on either
side from each other.</p>

<p>In the <i>Description</i> of towns the places of interest have been
taken in the order of their position, so that, if a cab be engaged, all
that is necessary is to mention to the driver their names in succession.
Cabs on such occasions should be hired by the hour. To guard against
omission, the traveller should underline the names of the places to be
visited before commencing the round. In France the Churches are open all
the day. In Italy they close at 12; but most of them reopen at 2 <span
class = "smallroman">P.M.</span> All the

<!-- png 007 -->
Picture-Galleries are open on Sundays, and very many also on Thursdays.
When not open to the public, admission is generally granted on payment
of a franc.</p>

<p>In “Table of Contents” the Routes are classified and explained. For
the Time-tables recommended, and for the mode of procedure on the
Continental Railways, see “Preliminary Information.”</p>

<p>Before commencing our description of the Winter Resorts on the
Mediterranean, with the best routes towards them, let it be clearly
understood that not even in the very mildest of these stations is it
safe for the invalid to venture out either in the early morning or after
sunset without being well protected with warm clothing; and that, even
with this precaution, the risk run of counteracting the beneficial
influences of a sojourn in these regions is so great as to render it
prudent to determine from the first to spend those hours always within
doors. On the other hand, it is most conducive to health, during the
sunny hours of the day, to remain as much as possible in the open air,
walking and driving along the many beautiful terraces and roads with
which these places abound; and if the day be well employed in such
exercise, it will be no great hardship to rest at home in the evening.
Nor is it necessary to remain in the same town during the entire season;
indeed a change of scene is generally most beneficial, for which the
railway as well as the steamers affords every facility. “I&nbsp;would
strongly advise every person who goes abroad for the recovery of his
health, whatever may be his disease or to what climate soever he may go,
to consider the change as placing him merely in a more favourable
situation for the removal of his disease; in fact, to bear constantly in
mind that the beneficial influence of travelling, of sailing, and of
climate requires to be aided by such dietetic regimen and general mode
of living, and by such remedial measures as would have been requisite in
his case had he remained in his own country. All the circumstances
requiring attention from the invalid at home should be equally attended
to abroad. If in some things greater latitude may be permitted, others
will demand
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<a name = "pagevii" id = "pagevii"> </a>
<!-- png 008 -->
even a more rigid attention. It is, in truth, only by a due regard to
all these circumstances that the powers of the constitution can be
enabled to throw off, or even materially mitigate, in the best climate,
a&nbsp;disease of long standing.</p>

<p>“It may appear strange that I should think it requisite to insist so
strongly on the necessity of attention to these directions; but I have
witnessed the injurious effects of a neglect of them too often not to
deem such remarks called for in this place. It was, indeed, matter of
surprise to me, during my residence abroad, to observe the manner in
which many invalids seemed to lose sight of the object for which they
left their own country&mdash;the recovery of their health. This appeared
to arise chiefly from too much being expected from climate.</p>

<p>“The more common and more injurious deviations from that system of
living which an invalid ought to adopt, consist in errors of diet,
exposure to cold, over-fatigue, and excitement in what is called
‘sight-seeing,’ frequenting crowded and over-heated rooms, and keeping
late hours. Many cases fell under my observation in which climate
promised the greatest advantage, but where its beneficial influence was
counteracted by the operation of these causes.” &mdash;<i>Sir James
Clark on the Sanative Influence of Climate.</i></p>

<p>Many after leaving the Riviera are the better of making a short stay
at some of the baths, such as <a href = "turin.html#page359">Vichy</a>
(p.&nbsp;359), <a href = "paris.html#page93">Vals</a> (p.&nbsp;93),
<a href = "turin.html#page378">Mont-Dore</a> (p.&nbsp;378), <a href =
"turin.html#page383">Bourboule</a> (p.&nbsp;383), <a href =
"turin.html#page283">Aix-les-Bains</a> (p.&nbsp;283), <a href =
"turin.html#page357">Bourbon-l’Archambault</a> (p.&nbsp;357), or <a href
= "turin.html#page358">Bourbon-Lancy</a> (p.&nbsp;358). If at the
eastern end of the Riviera, the nearest way to them is by rail from
Savona (pp. <a href = "riviera.html#page209">209</a> and <a href =
"riviera.html#page183">183</a>), or from Genoa (pp. <a href =
"riviera.html#page212">212</a> and <a href =
"riviera.html#page279">279</a>) to <a href =
"turin.html#page292">Turin</a> (p.&nbsp;292). From Turin a short branch
line extends to <a href = "turin.html#page305">Torre-Pèllice</a>
(p.&nbsp;305), situated in one of the most beautiful of the Waldensian
valleys.</p>

<p>If the journey from Turin to Aix-les-Bains, 128 miles, be too long,
a&nbsp;halt may be made for the night at <a href =
"turin.html#page290">Modane</a> (p.&nbsp;290); where, however, on
account of the elevation, 3445 ft., the air is generally rather sharp
and bracing.</p>

<a name = "pageviii" id = "pageviii"> </a>
<!-- png 009 -->

<p>From the western end of the Riviera the best way north and to the
baths is by the valley of the Rhône (<a href = "paris.html#map27">map,
p.&nbsp;27</a>), in which there are many places of great interest, such
as <a href = "paris.html#page68">Arles</a> (p.&nbsp;68), <a href =
"paris.html#page58">Avignon</a> (p.&nbsp;58), <a href =
"paris.html#page51">Orange</a> (p.&nbsp;51), and <a href =
"paris.html#page29">Lyons</a> (p.&nbsp;29). From Lyons take the western
branch by <a href = "turin.html#page349">Montbrison</a> (p.&nbsp;349)
for Vichy, Mont-Dore, and Bourboule. For Aix-les-Bains take the eastern
by <a href = "turin.html#page281">Ambérieux</a> (p.&nbsp;281) and
<a href = "turin.html#page282">Culoz</a> (p.&nbsp;282). From Avignon,
<a href = "paris.html#page54">Carpentras</a> (p.&nbsp;54), Pont-St. <a href
= "paris.html#page98">Esprit</a> (p.&nbsp;98), <a href =
"paris.html#page48">Montélimart</a> (p.&nbsp;48), La <a href =
"paris.html#page82">Voulte</a> (p.&nbsp;82), <a href =
"paris.html#page46">Crest</a> (p.&nbsp;46) and <a href =
"turin.html#page324">Grenoble</a> (p.&nbsp;324), interesting and
picturesque excursions are made. From Carpentras Mont <a href =
"paris.html#page56">Ventoux</a> (p.&nbsp;56) is visited. From La Voulte,
<a href = "paris.html#page45">Ardechè</a> (p.&nbsp;45) is entered. From
Crest diligences run to the towns and villages between it and Aspres
(pp. <a href = "paris.html#page47">47</a> and <a href =
"turin.html#page345">345</a>). From Grenoble the roads and railways
diverge which lead to the lofty peaks of the western Alps and to the
mountain passes between France and Italy.</p>

<p class = "space">
None should go abroad without a passport. Even where several are
travelling together in one party, each should have his own passport.
They are easily procured and easily carried, and may be of great
use.</p>

<p class = "space">
The best hotels in the places frequented by the Americans and English
cost per day from 12 to 22 frs., and the pensions from 9 to 15 frs.,
including wine (often sour) in both. The general charge in the hotels of
the other towns throughout France is from 8 to 9&nbsp;frs. per day. Meat
breakfast, 2 to 3&nbsp;frs.; dinner, 3 to 4&nbsp;frs.; service, ½ fr.;
“café au lait,” with bread and butter, 1½ fr. The omnibus between the
hotel and the station costs each from 6 to 10 sous. The driver in most
cases loads and unloads the luggage himself at the station, when he
expects a small gratuity from 2 to 10 sous, according to the quantity of
bags and trunks. The omnibuses of the Riviera hotels cost from 1½ to
2&nbsp;frs. each, and although the conductor does not unload the luggage
he expects a gratuity.</p>

<p>Neither jewellery nor money should be carried in portmanteaus. When a
stay of merely a day or two is intended, the bulky and heavy luggage
should be left in depôt at the station. Some companies charge 1, others
2 sous for each article (colis) per day. See “Railways” in “Preliminary
Information.”</p>

<h5 class = "ital">Railway Time-Tables.</h5>

<p>Time-tables or Indicateurs. For France the most useful and only
official time-tables are those published by Chaix and C<sup>ie</sup>,
and sold at all the railway stations. Of these excellent publications
there are various kinds. The most complete and most expensive is the
“Livret-Chaix Continental,” which, besides the time-tables of the French
railways, gives those also of the whole Continent, and is furnished with
a complete index; size 18mo, with about 800 pages. The “Livret-Chaix
Continental” is sold at the station bookstalls. Price 2&nbsp;frs.</p>

<p>Next in importance is the “Indicateur des Chemins de Fer,” sold at
every station; size 128 small folio pages, price 60 c. It contains the
time-tables of the French railways alone, and an index and railway
map.</p>

<p>The great French lines of the “Chemins de Fer de l’Ouest,” of the
“Chemins de Fer d’Orleans,” of the “Chemins de Fer de Paris à Lyon et à
la Méditerranée,” of the “Chemins de Fer du Nord,” and of the “Chemins
de Fer de l’Est,” have each time-tables of their own, sold at all their
stations. Price 40 c. Size 18<sup>me</sup>. With good index.</p>

<p>For Belgium, the best time-tables are in the “Guide Officiel sur tous
les Chemins de Fer de Belgique.” Sold at the Belgian railway stations.
Size 18<sup>me</sup>. Price 30 c. It contains a good railway map of
Belgium.</p>

<p>For Italy, use “L’Indicatore Ufficiale delle Strade Ferrate
d’Italia.” Containing excellent maps illustrating their circular tours.
Price 1&nbsp;fr.</p>

<p>In Spain use the “Indicador de los Ferro-Carriles,” sold at the
stations. The distances are, as in the French tables, in kilometres, of
which 8 make 5&nbsp;miles. <i>Lleg.</i> or <i>Llegada</i> means
“arrival”; <i>Salida</i>, “departure.”</p>

<p>In England consult the “Continental Time-tables of the London,
Chatham, and Dover Railway,” sold at the Victoria Station, Pimlico,
price 2d.; or those of the London and South-Eastern, 1d.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">In the Railway Station.</h5>

<p>Before going to the station, it is a good plan to turn up in the
index of the “Livret-Chaix Continental” the place required, to ascertain
the fare and the time of starting, which stations are supplied with
refreshment rooms (marked&nbsp;B), and the time the train halts at each
on its way.</p>

<p>On arriving at the station join the single file (queue) of people
before the small window (guichet), where the tickets (billets) are sold.
Your turn having arrived, and having procured your ticket, proceed to
the luggage department, where deposit your baggage and deliver your
ticket to be stamped. The luggage tickets are called also
“bulletins.”</p>

<p>After your articles have been weighed, your ticket, along with a
luggage receipt, is handed you from the “guichet” of the luggage office,
where, if your baggage is not overweight, you pay 10&nbsp;c. or 2 sous.
Before pocketing the luggage ticket, just run your eye down the column
headed “Nombre de Colis,” and see that the exact number of your articles
has been given. The French have a strange way of making the figures
3,&nbsp;5,
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
<!-- png 013 -->
and 7. Whatever is overweight is paid for at this office; but remember,
when two or more are travelling together, to present the tickets of the
whole party at the luggage department, otherwise the luggage will be
treated as belonging to one person, and thus it will probably be
overweight. Another advantage of having the entire number of the party
on the “Billet de Bagage” is that, in case of one or other losing their
carriage tickets, this will prove the accident to the stationmaster
(chef-de-Gare) and satisfy him. If, after having purchased a ticket, the
train is missed, that ticket, to be available for the next train, must
be presented again to the ticket office, to be re-stamped (être
visé).</p>

<p>The traveller, on arriving at his destination, will frequently find
it more convenient not to take his luggage away with him; in which case,
having seen it brought from the train to the station, he should tell the
porter that he wishes it left there. He retains, however, his luggage
ticket, which he only presents when he desires his luggage again.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">On the Railway.</h5>

<p>In the carriage cast the eye over the line as given in our railway
map, and note the junctions; for at many of these&mdash;such as Amiens,
Rouen, Culoz, Macon, etc. etc.&mdash;the passengers are frequently
discharged from the carriages and sent into the waiting-rooms to await
other trains. On such occasions great attention must be paid to the
names the porter calls out when he opens the door of the waiting-room,
otherwise the wrong train may be taken. To avoid this, observe on our
railway map what are the principal towns along the line in the direction
required to go; so that when, for example, he calls out, “Voyageurs du
Côté de Lyon!” and we be going to Marseilles from Macon, we may, with
confidence, enter the train, because, by reference to the map, we see we
must pass Lyon to reach Marseilles. The little railway map will be found
very useful, and ought always to be kept in readiness for reference.</p>

<p><i>Buffet</i> means “refreshment-room”; and <i>Salle d’Attente</i>,
“waiting-room.”</p>

<p>There are separate first, second, and third class carriages for
ladies.</p>

<p>Express trains have third class carriages for long distances.</p>


<h5 class = "ital">Railway Omnibuses.</h5>

<p>At the stations of the largest and wealthiest towns three kinds of
omnibuses await the arrival of passengers. They may be distinguished by
the names of the General Omnibus, the Hotel Omnibus, and the Private
Omnibus. The general omnibus takes passengers to all parts of the town
for a fixed sum, rarely above half a franc; so that, should the omnibus
be full, it is some time till the last passenger gets put down at his
destination. The hotel omnibus takes passengers only to the hotel or
hotels whose name or names it bears.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
