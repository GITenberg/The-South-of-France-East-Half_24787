Culoz. The best of the statues are those of Charles Felix, King of
Sardinia (died 1821), and of Marie Christine, his spouse (died 1849), on

This ancient town, with narrow arcaded streets, is situated on the
north-west end of Lake Annecy. The two most prominent buildings in
Annecy, as seen from the lake, are the Barracks, and the Castle of
Tresun, in which St. François de Sales, the founder of the Order of the
Visitation, was born August 21, 1567. Opposite the steamboat-pier is
another prominent edifice, the Church and Convent of St. Joseph, both
modern, but containing, in the garden behind, the first chapel erected
by St. Francis, dating from 1610. The house Madame Chantale, his friend,
inhabited adjoins this chapel.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The mortal remains of St. Francis are in a shrine above the high altar
in the Church of the Visitation, at the western side of the Rue Royale.
The house in which he resided is in No. 18 Rue St. Claire, entrance at
the left-hand corner within the court. The house in which Madame de
Warrens first received Rousseau stood in the parallel street, behind the
Rue de l’Évêché, on the site of that house next the Episcopal palace,
with railings in front. The best promenade is the garden around the
Hôtel de Ville at the head of the lake. It contains a statue by
Marochetti of the great French chemist, Claude Louis Berthollet, born at
Talloires in 1748.</p>

The Lake of Annecy is 9 m. long, 2 broad, and 1455 ft. above the

South from Veyrier, also on the lake, is the village of Menthon, the
birthplace of St. Bernard, the founder, in the 10th cent., of the
hospices of the Great and the Little St. Bernard. He is buried on the
right-hand side of the choir in the cathedral of Lausanne. At the south
extremity of the lake is the village of Doussard, at the entrance into
the dark gorge of the Combe Noire. Here a coach awaits passengers for
Faverges and Albertville, 18 miles south from Doussard. In this
neighbourhood the best mountain to ascend for the view is Semnoz, 4148
ft. above the lake. The ascent is made from the straggling village of
Leschaux, 1590 ft. above the lake, 10&nbsp;m. S. from Annecy, and
14&nbsp;m. N.E. from Aix-les-Bains. Donkeys can be hired at the village.
The ascent takes about 2 hrs. On the top is a comfortable inn. Duingt,

and 490&nbsp;m. S.E. from Paris. The city derives its name from the
tribe Taurini, who were first the opponents and then the allies of the
Romans. When Hannibal descended from the Alps he destroyed the city,
that he might have nothing to dread from its hostility. Having risen
speedily from its ruins, it received within its walls the army of
reserve of Julius Cæsar when he marched against the Gauls. Under the
Lombards it was made the capital of a duchy, and became the favourite
residence of Queen Theodolinda, who, in 602, built the church of
S.&nbsp;Giovanni Battista, now the cathedral of Turin, reconstructed in
1498. Francis&nbsp;I. so damaged Turin in 1536 that its entire
reconstruction became necessary. The streets are wide, clean, and well
paved, and pass through spacious squares ornamented with statues and
bordered by handsome arcades. The most aristocratic part of Turin is the

the wide and handsome Corso Vittorio Emanuele, which traverses the city

earthy-coloured brick edifice, of which the ornaments, mouldings, and
cornices are also of dingy brick. On the ground-floor are the more
massive, and in the first story the smaller antiquities. In the second
story is the picture gallery, containing about 800 paintings in fifteen
rooms. Open daily from 9 to 4, 1&nbsp;fr. On Sundays and feast-days
free, when it is open from 12 to 4. The large antiquities are contained

Museum of Zoology and Mineralogy.</a></h5>

<p>Opposite the Palazzo dell’ Accademia, but a little to the left, is
the Palazzo Carignano, also by Guarini, and also of earthy-coloured
brick; but the decorations are superior, more varied, and more pleasing
than those of the Palazzo dell’ Accademia. In large gilt letters, on the
façade fronting the Piazza Carignano and the statue of Gioberti, are the
words, “Qui nacque Vittorio Emanuele&nbsp;II.” Within is a high and
spacious court, surrounded by lofty halls, and at the east end, fronting
the Piazza Carlo Alberto, with the beautiful bronze monument to him by
Marochetti, cast in London, is the more pretentious stone façade, built
in 1871, but not in harmony with the rest of the building. (See also

housed, are the zoological and mineralogical collections. Open daily,

Royal Armoury.</a></h5>

<p>No. 13 Palazzo Castello, open on feast-days from 11 to 3&nbsp;free.
On other days procure admission from the secretary. This collection is
of great interest only to the inhabitants of northern Italy, as it is
filled chiefly with relics of their kings, dukes, and wars. In the first
room is “Favorito,” the favourite horse of the magnanimous Ré, Carlo
Alberto. Above it, near the roof, are numerous tattered flags taken in
battle. In the large hall are two rows of armed knights and
foot-soldiers. At the head of this hall, in a glass case, numbered 301,
is an embossed oval shield, inlaid with gilding, and surrounded by a
fringe of massive gold thread. On five medallions are represented, in
<i>alto-relievo</i>, scenes from the war of Marius against Jugurtha. It
belongs to the school of Giulio Romano, was executed probably in the
latter half of the 16th cent., and was presented to the university of
Turin by the Princess Vittoria di Sassonia Hilburghausen. Among the
relics are the sword worn by Napoleon at the battle of Marengo, the
saddle of Charles&nbsp;V., and some beautifully inlaid body-armour of
the Dukes of Savoy. The large door at the end of this hall opens into
the “Medagliere del Ré,” containing 30,000 Greek, Roman and ancient
coins and medals, including a complete series of those struck in the
State of Sardinia; and also 5000 medallions, seals and stamps. In this
same part is the Biblioteca del Ré, with 40,000 vols., 1800 MSS.,
numerous autographs, engravings and drawings by the great masters. To
visit these special permission must be obtained. From the windows of the
armoury is a view of the palace-gardens.

At the N.E. angle of the Piazza Castello is the Teatro Regio, considered
the finest work of Benedetto Alfieri. It is seated for 2500, and is open
only during carnival and on extraordinary occasions.

Turin: Royal Palace.</a></span>
In the absence of the royal family the palace may be visited. It is a
plain brick building, commenced in 1646, with the front to the Piazza
Castello, plastered to imitate stone. Having passed the main entrance,
turn to the left. At the end of this corridor is seen, through a glass
door, the equestrian statue of Vittorio Amadeo&nbsp;I. (died 1675) in a
niche at the foot of the grand staircase. The rider is in bronze, the
horse in marble. Ascend the marble steps, then, to the right, two
flights of narrow steps lead to the hall of the palace, where the
servants will be found who show the palace. Fee, 1&nbsp;fr.; party,
2&nbsp;frs. After the guardroom succeeds a series of rooms with much
gilding, inlaid floors, and rich furniture. The pictures are all modern,
and of no great merit. The room called Maria Theresa’s contains some
fine china vases.</p>

The Cathedral.</a></h5>

<p>Adjoining the western end of the palace is the <b>Cathedral San
Giovanni Battista</b>. To the left of the altar is the pew of the royal
family. Behind the altar, and approached by two staircases of 37 steps
each, is the <b>Cappella del Sudario</b> (open till 9 <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span>), a&nbsp;circular chapel, separated from the
church by a glass screen. It was built by Guarini in 1694, and is
encrusted with the dark grayish-blue marble from Fabrosa, near Mondovi,
which brings out in striking relief the pure white of the statues and
the rich gilding of the ornaments, cornices, capitals, and eight-limbed
stars which spangle the interior. Double monolith columns of the same
dark marble, with bronze pedestals and capitals, support six arches
ornamented with diaper-work on the soffits. Above them rise six smaller
arches containing the windows, while the dome or cupola is composed of
an intricate series of interlacing zigzag arched ribs rising from the
second tier, and intermingled with loopholes, which throw light in such
a manner upon the star at the summit as to give it the appearance of
being suspended. The beautiful altar, lighted with gold and silver
lamps, has two faces, so that two masses are said before it at the same
time. The shrine on this altar is said to contain the shroud (Sudario)
in which Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of our Lord when he laid
Him in the tomb. Round the chapel are the beautiful white marble
monuments of three kings of the house of Savoy&mdash;Em. Filiberto (ob.
1580), by Marchesi; Carlo Emanuele&nbsp;II. (ob. 1675), by Fraccaroli;
and Amedeo VIII., first Duke of Savoy (ob.

behind the altar communicates with the upper corridors of the palace.
Outside the palace gates is <a name = "turin_san_lorenzo" id =

<p>The large brick building in the centre of the Piazza Castello was
erected in the 13th century, and called the Castello till 1718, when it
became the favourite residence of the widow of Carlo Emanuele&nbsp;II.,
Madama M.&nbsp;G. Battista, who built the stone façade, and in honour of
whom it has ever since been called the Palazzo Madama. Before the seat
of government was removed to Florence the senators assembled in the
great hall of this palace. One of the towers is used as an observatory,
and another part of the palace by the “Accademia reale di Medicina,” who
here hold their meetings, and have also a museum of craniology.</p>

of celebrated Piedmontese. <b>2.</b>&nbsp;Water-colours, representing
landscapes and historical scenes in Piedmont. Under glass frame is a
solid oblong chased silver vase, 3 ft. and some inches in its greater
diameter, and 2 ft. 8 inches in its smaller. At each of the two long
ends is a lion’s head with a ring in his mouth. Near this vase, and also
under a glass frame, and also in solid silver, are two candelabra,
a&nbsp;vase, and two flower-holders adorned with figures in relief. The
first was presented in 1871 by the English Government, and the other by
that of the United States to the Count Frederic Sclopis, President of
the Geneva arbitration in the Alabama question, and given to this
institution by his widow. None of them display much art; as for the
English vase, it needs only a lid to turn it into a respectable
soup-tureen.</p>

The Via di Po.</a></h5>

<p>The finest of the streets is the <b>Via di Po</b>, which extends from
the Piazza Castello to the great rectangular square, the Piazza Vittorio
Emanuele, on the bank of the Po; and as both of these spacious squares,
as well as this magnificent street, are lined throughout with wide and
lofty arcades, they form together an excellent and interesting walk in
all weathers. The Via di Po is 768 yards long and 19½ wide, and the
pavement within the arcade 6½ yards wide. Good shops are ranged on both
sides of the street under the arcades. In the Via di Po is also the
<a name = "turin_university" id = "turin_university"><b>University</b></a>,
built in 1713 by Vittorio Amedeo&nbsp;II., but founded in 1404 by the
Prince Lodovico di Acaia. It is attended by 2500 students, and directed
by 70 professors. The Library, open every day from 9 to 4, contains
200,000 volumes and 3000 MSS. In the court are Roman bas-reliefs,
inscriptions, and statues, ancient and modern. Between the Via di Po and
the Piazza Carlo Emanuele ramifies the Via dell’ Accademia Albertina,
containing at No. 6 the Accademia Albertina delle Belle Arti. Open
daily. Apply to the custodi.</p>

<p>The <a name = "turin_piazza_vitt_em" id =
"turin_piazza_vitt_em"><b>Piazza Vittorio Emanuele</b></a> is 394 yards
long and 121½ wide. In front, on the other side of the Po, is a
conspicuous church, the Gran <a name = "turin_madre_di_dio" id =
"turin_madre_di_dio"><b>Madre di Dio</b></a>, built in 1818, in the
style of the Pantheon at Rome, by Bansignori, to commemorate the return
of Vittorio Emanuele&nbsp;I. to Turin after the fall of Napoleon.
A&nbsp;little to the right on a hill (Il Monte) is a Capuchin convent,
built towards the end of the 16th cent. The road up is very easy, and
the view from the terrace admirable. Immediately above the Madre di Dio
church is the palace, La Vigna della Regina, built by Prince Maurice of
Savoy, which after his time was inhabited by one of the queens of
Sardinia, from whom it acquired its present name, “The Queen’s
Vineyard.” It is now a government school for the education of children
of military men. Up the river, beyond the suspension bridge, is the
Castello del Valentino, distinguished from a distance by its four
pavilions with high-pitched roofs. It was built by the widow of Victor
Amadeus&nbsp;I., daughter of Henri IV. of France, and is now used as a
government school of civil engineering. It contains a good collection of
minerals, the larger part of which, obtained from Sardinian provinces,
are topographically arranged. The <b>Botanical Garden</b> belonging to
the university is also here.</p>

Monuments.</a></h5>

<p>In the Piazza Carlo Emanuele II., a short way S. from Piazza
Castello, is the monument to Camillo Cavour, by Dupré of Florence, for
which he received £1200, contributed by the inhabitants of every part of
Italy in 1872. The statues are in white marble, the tablets and friezes
in bronze, and the pedestal in granite. The monument is tame and mystic.
Cavour, in an upright position, holds in his hand a scroll bearing the
words, “libera chiesa in libero stato.” (See <a href =
"#page294">p.&nbsp;294</a>.) The climate of Turin is more suitable for
bronze than for marble statues. To the west is the Piazza S.&nbsp;Carlo,
with a bronze monument to Emanuele Filiberto (see <a href =
"#page293">p.&nbsp;293</a>). Farther west, in the Piazza Solferino, is
the remarkable, almost painful, bronze group representing Ferdinando di
Savoia (brother of&nbsp;V. Emanuele&nbsp;II.) at the battle of Novara in
1848. When about to lead the charge on the Bicocca his horse fell,
mortally wounded. The poor animal, on bended knees, with gaping mouth
and outstretched neck, seems about to breathe its last in an agony of
suffering.</p>

<p>A short way west from the Piazza Castello by the Via Palazzo di Citta
is the Piazza del Palazzo di Citta, having on one side the Palazzo di
Citta, or the Municipality buildings, designed by Lanfrachi, and erected
in 1659. At the entrance to the Palazzo are the marble statues of the
celebrated Prince Eugene and the Duke of Genoa, brother of King Victor
Emanuel, and under the portico statues of Prince Thomas di Carignano and
Victor Emanuel. In the centre of the square is a bronze group
representing Count Verde (Amadeus&nbsp;VI.) over a fallen Saracen. Close
to this square is the church of Corpus Domini, with the interior
encrusted with beautiful marble, and ornamented with frescoes and
gilding. From this the Via Milano leads towards the Piazza Em.
Filiberto, passing by on the left S.&nbsp;Domenico, and on the right the
Basilica. In S.&nbsp;Domenico, in the first chapel to the right of the
altar, is a picture of the Virgin by Guercino.</p>

<p>Near the Piazza Em. Filiberto, by the Via Giulio, is the church
<a name = "turin_la_consolata" id = "turin_la_consolata"><b>La

churches built at different periods. On the principal altar is a
miracle-working image of the Virgin; while a great part of the adjoining
walls is hung with pictures illustrating the cures and deliverances
effected by it. Two lovely kneeling figures, in the most precious
Carrara marble, looking towards the altar, represent respectively Maria
Theresa, queen of Carlo Alberto, and Maria Adelaide, queen of Vit.
Emanuele,

dressed in the same way as they used to be when they attended worship
every Sunday in this chapel. They both died in 1855. In the square
outside, on a granite column, is a statue of the Virgin, erected in
fulfilment of a vow when the cholera raged in 1835.</p>

<p>In the Piazza Savoia, near the Piazza dello Statuto, is an obelisk 72
ft. high, erected in 1854 to commemorate the abolition of the
ecclesiastical courts. On the four sides are the names of the towns
which contributed to the monument.</p>

<p>Less than a mile from the Ponte delle Benne is the <a name =
"turin_cemetery" id = "turin_cemetery">cemetery</a> or Campo Santo of
Turin. (See N.E. corner of plan.) It is badly kept and not worth
visiting. The inner or new part is a little better.</p>

<p>A little to the W. of the P. Solferino, and parallel to it, is the
citadel and the barracks of the Cernaia. In front of the entrance is the
monument to Pietro Mico, who, to save the citadel from the enemy, sprang
a mine at the cost of his own life.</p>

La Superga.</a></h5>

<p>Leave by the steam tram starting from the Piazza Castello; the
time-table is in the waiting-room, where the tickets are also sold half
an hour before starting. As the train can take only a limited number,
the tickets are generally all taken in the first 10 minutes. The tram
runs down the Via Po, crosses the Ponte Vit. Emanuele&nbsp;I., passes by
the western end of the church, the “Great Mother of God,” and descends
by the left side of the Po to the Cassale station, whence the ascent
commences by the rope and locomotive railway constructed by Agudio, and
opened in 1884. The ascent takes 20 minutes, the length is 3500 yards,
the average inclination 13%, and the greatest 20%. At the Superga
station are waiting-rooms, and a few feet below them a commodious
restaurant. On arriving at the station ascend by the road, right hand,
for the Superga. The walk down the mountain is very pleasant, and it is
probable that the pedestrian will fall in with some tram when on the
main road to Turin.</p>

<p>The Superga is situated 4½ m. N.E. from Turin, on a mountain 1420 ft.
above the Po, or 2146 ft. above the sea, and cost £100,000. It was
commenced by Vittorio Amedeo&nbsp;II. in 1717, and finished in 1731, to
fulfil a vow made by him on 7th September 1706, for the victory over the
French at the battle of Turin, when the house of Savoy regained the
duchy. The architect was Filippo Juvara.</p>

<p>Enter by door at the north side of the building, where the men will
be

found who conduct visitors over the church. Gratuity optional. The first
hall shown contains small and indifferent portraits of all the popes.
Then down 27 large marble steps to the crypt. At the foot is a white
marble group, St. Michael overcoming Satan. None of the monuments are
worthy the name of royal mausoleums. The best are: in centre, Carlo
Alberto, 1779-1849; at right hand end, Carlo Emanuele&nbsp;III.,
1701-1773; towards left, Duke Ferdinando de Genova, a&nbsp;colossal
white marble statue; at left end, Vittorio Amedeo&nbsp;II., the founder,
1666-1732. In an adjoining vault children under seven are buried.</p>

<p>From this ascend by 357 steps from floor of church to the gallery
outside the lantern. A&nbsp;door about 80 steps up opens into the
gallery round the interior of the octagonal dome, whence the church is
well seen. The top of the lantern is 229½ ft. above the pavement of the
church.</p>

<p>The chief object for visiting the Superga is the splendid view from
the outside gallery of the lantern. In one direction is the plain of
Piedmont with the Po wandering across it; everywhere else the horizon is
bounded by a vast chain of snowy Alps, with Monte Rosa on one side and
Mont Blanc on the other.</p>

<p>Among the delicacies of Turin are the <a name = "turin_lamprede" id =
"turin_lamprede">lamprede</a>, thin eels from 5 to 8 inches long, caught
in the Po. They are killed by being plunged into milk. The white
truffles are also celebrated, and when cooked “à la Piedmontese” or “à
la fonduta,” and taken with a bottle of Asti wine, make most enjoyable
dishes. <a name = "turin_wines" id = "turin_wines">The vermouth of
Turin</a> is an agreeable aperitive, and is taken before sitting down to
table. The best wines of Piedmont are the Caluzo, a&nbsp;white wine; the

a&nbsp;strong red wine; and the Nebrolo. The Gressini are double baked
bread in strips 18 inches long and a quarter of an inch thick. In the
Italian houses a handful of them is put down to each cover at the
dinner-table. They are made at very many places besides Turin; even at
Cannes on the Riviera. A&nbsp;great deal of maccheroni (macaroni) is
consumed in Italy. In Turin are important silk mills.</p>

<p>The chief town, Torre-Pèllice (formerly called Torre-Luserna) is 34¼
miles S.W. from Turin by rail, passing by Pinerolo, 23½&nbsp;m. S.W.
from Turin, and 10¾&nbsp;m. N.E. from Torre-Pèllice. From Pinerolo a

<p>The country of the Italian Waldenses consists of parts of the valleys
of Pèllice, San Martino, and Perosa or Chisone, is about 20&nbsp;m. long
from W. to E. by 13 broad, is divided into 15 parishes, exclusive of the
isolated parish of Turin, and contains a population of about 25,000.
They have besides a thriving colony in Uruguay. Till Cavour in 1848
procured for Italy civil and religious liberty, the Waldenses were
confined by law to their valleys; now, however, they have spread
themselves over the best parts of Italy, while many emigrate every year
to the United States and to Uruguay. Of late mills and manufactories
have been established on their rivers, which has caused a large influx
of Piedmontese workmen, so that many Waldensian towns and villages which
up to 1848 were inhabited almost exclusively by Protestants have now a
larger population of Romanists.</p>

<p>These valleys are very fertile, bearing luxuriant crops of maize,
wheat, barley, potatoes, French beans, etc., intersected by long rows

<p>The Vaudois inhabited originally not only the valleys on the E. side
of the Alps but also those of Louise, Embrun, and Barcelonnette on the
French side (<a href = "#val_louise_2">pp.&nbsp;344, 345</a>), and, as
there was constant communication between them, French became the common
language, as it is still in a great measure. They consider themselves a
part of the Apostolic Church, which by its isolated position in the then
almost inaccessible ravines had escaped the early innovations introduced
by the church of Rome; albeit not altogether, for they admitted
confession by contrite prayer to God and the mention aloud of their sins
to a priest, the power of priests to bind and to loose, that sins were
of two classes, mortal and venial, and the efficacy of fasts and
penance. At the Reformation all these were swept away, and the doctrines
and church polity of Calvin adopted. The independent church of the
Waldenses, or valley-people, existed about a century before the arrival
of Pierre Valdo from Lyons in 1180. Their name is supposed to be derived
from “valle densa,” contracted into Vallenses, Valdenses, and finally
Vaudois. The first serious persecution of the Italian Vaudois was begun
at the instigation of Yolande, sister of Louis XI and wife of Amadée
IX., Duke of Savoy. By her representation Innocent VIII. in 1487
fulminated against the Waldenses a bull of extermination. Whoever killed
any of these heretics were to be absolved from promises they had made,
property wrongly obtained by them was to be rendered legal, and they
were to have a complete remission of all their sins. Persecution among
the French Vaudois commenced in the 13th cent.</p>

<p><i>The Ducal Garden</i>, open daily to the public, is on the other
side of the river, and may be reached from the palace by a bridge called
the Ponte Verde. It is a large piece of ground, laid out in a formal
style; but when its chestnuts, limes, and acacias, are in leaf, it
affords a pleasant promenade. Within the grounds is a palace called
Palazzo di Giardino. The <i>Botanic Gardens</i> are at the other side of
the town,

a&nbsp;good specimen of Italian Gothic, built in the 13th and 14th
cents. The portals are adorned with lions, by B. da Bisoni, 1281. In the
interior, along the top of clustered articulated columns, runs an
elegant triforium, and over it extends a lofty elliptical roof, painted
by G.&nbsp;Mazzola. The choir is above the level of the nave. Within the
great door, left side, is a portrait of Correggio, and on the other, one
of Parmegianino. <i>The cupola</i> was painted by <i>Correggio</i>
(1526-30), with frescoes representing the <i>Assumption of the
Virgin</i>, but they are in a ruined state. Those on the vault of the
right transept were by a son of Correggio, while those on the left
transept were by Orazio Sammachini. In the Capella dei Canonici, on the
right side of the church, at the foot of the choir-steps, is an
altar-piece by B.&nbsp;Gatti; and near it a poor bust of Petrarch, with
an inscription recording that he was archdeacon here. Beneath the choir
is a spacious crypt, supported by thirty-four marble columns. On the
walls of the sacristy are frescoes of the 14th century, and intarsias by
L.&nbsp;Biancho.</p>

of fantastic carvings below, combine to render this one of the most

two tiers of galleries, some rude sculpture, and a profusion of fresco
painting&mdash;old, but not of much value. At the middle is a great
font, hewn out of one piece of marble, and having in the centre a place

at one side, ornamented with carvings, and supported by a marble lion.

three doorways. On the side next the Piazza Grande is a handsome porch,
with columns resting on rudely-carved lions of red marble. The interior,
though low, and destitute of paintings of merit, is interesting,
especially for the sub-choral chapel, with a roof supported by many
marble columns. At the entrance of this chapel is a group of lions, and
in one corner life-size figures in coloured terra-cotta, by Begarelli,
representing the Nativity. In the church notice the holy-water fonts,
which look as if they were the hollowed capitals of ancient columns, and
the stone pulpit with bas-reliefs. On the right side of the choir are
some curious old bas-reliefs, including one of the Last Supper; and on

At the head of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele is the <b>Ducal Palace</b>,
an immense pile, containing the Picture-Gallery, occupying several halls
in the upper stories, with an entrance on the north side. It is open
daily from 9 to 4. The collection comprises between 500 and 600
pictures, amongst which, though there are no <i>chefs d’œuvre</i>, are
many good ones. The gallery once ranked high amongst Italian galleries,
but towards the end of the last century 180 pictures were sold,
including five Correggios, to the King of Poland (they are now at
Dresden); and the Duke when expelled in 1860 took away with him a few
more of the best. In two of the rooms are glazed cases full of drawings
and sketches by the old masters. Amongst them is a drawing in sepia for
Tintoretto’s masterpiece, the Miracle of St. Mark at Venice. In a room
kept locked, but which the custode will open on application, are some
interesting cabinets (one designed, it is said, by B.&nbsp;Cellini,
another of amber, a&nbsp;third of tortoise-shell); also bronzes, carving
in wood and ivory, majolica, enamels, etc. Amongst other curiosities is
a “Presepio,” with numerous figures in coral, the metal work being of

<p>Bologna is a walled city, with twelve gates, situate on a fertile
plain near the foot of the Apennine range. The Bolognese school of
painting is called the Scuola Caraccesca, from its founders, Lodovico

(b.&nbsp;1560, d.&nbsp;1609) and Agostino, a&nbsp;man of erudition, who
furnished the general plan of the pictures. Their most distinguished
pupils were Guido Reni (b.&nbsp;1575, d.&nbsp;1642), Domenichino

<b>Santo Stefano</b> is a combination of ancient churches, chapels, and
courts, on the site of a temple dedicated to Isis. Enter first the
Church of the Crucifix, so named from the old painting at the great
altar. In the 1st chapel on the right is a picture by Muratori; in the
2d on the left St. Elisabetta, by Gessi. Then pass through a small
chapel into the circular chapel styled San Sepolchro, which contains the
tomb of St. Petronius, with curious carvings, and a miraculous well,
considered to have healing virtues. This building is thought to have
been formerly the baptistery of the next chapel (originally, perhaps,
the principal chapel), dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul. From a small
court, called the Atrium of Pilate, from its alleged resemblance to that
at Jerusalem, we gain access to the chapel of the Trinity, which
contains four marble columns said to have belonged to the temple of
Isis, and some pictures by Tiarini and others. There are ancient mural
paintings in the sanctuary dedicated to Our Lady of Consolation; and in
the subterranean chapel of the Confession, a&nbsp;broken column is shown
which is said to afford the measure of the Saviour’s height. After
visiting a cloister, where the columns show much variety of form, we
have made the complete tour of this singular labyrinth of buildings,
which are of great interest to the ecclesiologist. Behind Santo Stefano
in the Strada Maggiore are (beginning at the leaning-towers’ end, see
plan), 2, S. Bartolommeo; 23, the Pal. Zampieri; 24 is the house of the
celebrated composer Rossini, built by him in 1825. On the opposite side

Imola. South from the principal square is (No. 1 in plan) the church of
<a name = "bologna_san_domenico" id = "bologna_san_domenico"><b>S.
Domenico</b></a>, attached to a convent where St. Dominic lived and
died. The church dates from the 12th cent., but restored in the 18th.
Interior&mdash;2d chapel right, Miracle of Ferrerio, by D.&nbsp;Creti.
Right of south transept&mdash;the splendidly decorated chapel of <i>St.
Dominic</i>, with his sarcophagus ornamented with bas-reliefs, by Nic.
di Pisa. The garlands and statuettes were by Nic. di Barri (Arca), 1469.
The kneeling angel on the right, and St. Petronius, over the
sarcophagus, were by Michael Angelo in his youth. The base of the tomb,
with its bas-reliefs illustrating the life of the Saint, was not added
until 1532, a&nbsp;work of Alfonso Lombardi. On the beautiful ceiling of
the chapel is a fresco by Guercino, “The Transformation” of St. Dominic.
The painting of the Saint burning Heretical Books (on the left wall) is
by L.&nbsp;Spada; that of the Saint recalling a Child to Life is by
Tiarini. In a chapel on the right side of the high altar is the Marriage
of Saint Catharine, by Filippino Lippi. The Adoration of the Magi at the
high altar is by Bart. Cesi. In the left transept should be noticed the
tomb of a Pepoli (1348), and on the wall a portrait of St. Thomas
Aquinas, considered here an accurate likeness, though painted 100 years
after the death of the saint.

Opposite St. Dominic’s chapel, and in the north transept, is the chapel
of the Rosary, containing in the centre, under a slab, the grave of
Guido Reni (b.&nbsp;1575; d.&nbsp;1642). Near him lie the remains of his

of whom there are 59, inhabit the top story; the wives, however, of
these servants, not being allowed to enter the convent, dwell in a house
a few yards distant kept by nuns. It is in this house also that ladies

numerous windings by a bullock-cart-road through vineyards, on the side
of the mountain exposed to the S., a&nbsp;square house is attained on
the plateau behind the fort. The view is magnificent, but it is still
better from the peak immediately above, where there is one of the
quarries of argillaceous siliceous limestone, extensively used for
making cement. Ascend either by the continuation of the same
bullock-road or by the steep footpath. The isolated mountain, so
prominent from the village of La Tronche, is Mt. Eynard, 4846 ft.
Although Grenoble is of great antiquity, all that remains of its early
history are some fragments of the walls built by Diocletian. The most
interesting of the buildings is the Palais des Dauphins, now the Palais
de Justice.

This is a most enjoyable little trip from Grenoble, and Sassenage itself
makes a very pleasant residence in May. An immense number of small
vehicles are constantly running to the Pont du Drac; whence it is a very
pleasant walk of a little more than 2½&nbsp;m. to Sassenage. The
suspension bridge over the Drac was one of the first of this kind
constructed in France, but instead of being hung on chains it is
supported by long narrow plates held together by strong pivots. The
gigantic and lofty cliffs about Sassenage are composed of limestone
strata of great thickness, much valued for building purposes. The path
to the Cuves commences at the left side (approaching) of the H.&nbsp;du
Commerce, and, having passed through a doorway, enters a kind of park
and ascends by the right side of the Furon. About 1½&nbsp;m. up is a
great cavern, so sharply cut that it looks as if it had been made
artificially, out of which rushes a copious stream of pure water. After
crossing the torrent, an ascent is made of a little more than 150 ft. to
an enormous vault, within which are two caves, called Les Cuves, out of
each of which rushes a great volume of water, which united passes under
the cavern below called the Four des Fées. After this two or three
beautiful cascades, quite near, are visited, and the Furon is crossed
and the return made by the left side of this most picturesque river.
From the Cuves side is seen part of the ruins of the old castle of the
Berangers, to which a series of steps leads up, commencing near the
mills, left bank. Their modern castle, built in the 17th cent., stands
within a large park adjoining the village. The large halls are furnished
with antique furniture and hung with paintings, a&nbsp;large proportion
being family and historical portraits. The bedrooms of the marquis and
marchioness are hung with old tapestry. The so-called Sassenage cheese
is made in the mountains around Villard and Lans, some miles to the
south of Grenoble. The general quality is not so good as formerly, as
more of the cream now is used for making butter.</p>

common level, but are considerably higher, a&nbsp;waterfall, often of
great beauty, almost invariably accompanies the meeting of the streams.
In ascending the valley of St. Christophe the gorge soon becomes
narrower, the rounded forms characterising the intruded lias are quickly
left, and, the torrent having been passed on a substantial bridge,
a&nbsp;very short distance brings us to a scene of sublime desolation.
A&nbsp;mountain on the right hand has at some remote time crumbled into
fragments and literally filled the valley from side to side with a
colossal heap of ruins. Through and amongst these winds a narrow path
practicable for mules, whilst the river dashes from rock to rock with
excessive commotion, sometimes passing under the fragments which it was
unable to displace. One huge slab of granite, wide enough for three
carriages to pass abreast, forms a natural and ponderous bridge,
harmonising with the desolation of the scene. On the right stands the
romantic village of Enchastraye, a&nbsp;hamlet consisting of a few
houses perched on a projecting rock in a tributary valley above one of

before reaching the hamlet a bridge crosses a very wild and narrow
cleft, through which foams a wild glacier stream called the Torrent du
Diable. 2 hrs. farther up the valley is the village of Les Etages,
commanding one of the finest Alpine views which the admirers of Swiss
scenery can desire, terminated by the Montagne d’Arsine, standing
immediately above the hamlet of La Berarde. It presents a series of
rocky pinnacles in manifold rows, between which the snow can scarcely
adhere; and as seen from Les Etages, especially by the morning light, is
comparable to the Aiguilles of Mont Blanc, while the valley which
stretches beyond it to the foot of Mont Pelvoux may almost rival the
scenery of the Allée Blanche. <a name = "la_berarde" id =

distinguished from the rest by a belfry. Cultivation ceases just at the
village; a&nbsp;few stunted pines are found still higher up, but there
is no wood worth mentioning in the valley above Venose. This excessive
sterility peculiarly characterises the valleys of Dauphiné. The village
of La Berarde is at a height of only 5710 ft., that of St. Christophe is
4825, and of Venose 3365, but the character of the scenery is, like that
of Switzerland, at a greater elevation. The unbroken rocky surfaces
deceive the eye to such an extent that it is difficult to realise the
enormous scale of these mountains. To ascertain their height we must
attempt to mount them, and even then the eye has some difficulty to
submit to the testimony of the limbs. The ascent of the Pointe des

is the Bec de l’Homme, 11,372 ft., with a smaller glacier. The ridge
called La Meije runs from E.S.E. to W.N.W., and is crowned by numerous
aiguilles of tolerably equal elevation. The two highest are towards the
eastern and western ends of the ridge, and are rather more than a mile
apart. Any attempts to ascend the highest or western aiguille must be
made from the northern side. The view of this mountain from the village
of La Grave can hardly be praised too highly; it is one of the very
finest road views in the Alps, and one cannot speak in exaggerated terms
of its jagged ridges, torrential glaciers, and tremendous precipices.

streets of Briançon are narrow and steep, little better than staircases,
down the centre of each of which runs a stream of water in a marble
gutter, with such an impulse that all manner of garbage thrown into it
quickly disappears. At the foot of Briançon is the fertile valley formed
by the union of the Guisanne with the Durance, surrounded by
carefully-cultivated mountains studded with villages. All the Briançon
coaches start from the Place du Temple, in front of the church. “The
neighbourhood of Briançon abounds in rare plants. Amongst them may be
mentioned Astragalus austriacus and A.&nbsp;vesicarius, Oxytropus
Halleri, Prunus brigantiaca, Telephium Imperati, Brassica repanda,
Berardia subacaulis, Rhaponticum heleniifolium, Crepis pygmæa, Androsace

approved of by the bishop of Grenoble are sold in the “magasin” of the
establishment, giving the history of the apparition, from which the
following is extracted:&mdash; “On the 19th of September 1846, at 2.30
<span class = "smallroman">P.M.</span>, was seen by a girl and a boy in
the place where the statue now is, a&nbsp;figure seated on a stone
shedding tears so copiously that they caused a dried-up spring, about 2
ft. in diameter and 2½ ft. deep, a&nbsp;little to her left, to flow
forth freely. Since then it has been fed by a pipe, and has been called
the miraculous fountain. The girl’s name was Fraçoise-Melanie Calvat
Mathieu, 15 years old, and the boy’s Pierre-Maximin Giraud, 11 years
old, both employed as cowherds, and both so ignorant that they could
neither read nor write. They understood only the patois, and had such
frail memories that the girl had as yet been hardly able to remember a
few lines of the catechism, while it had taken the boy three years to
learn the Pater Noster and the Avé Maria. The statues of the children in
the path between the railings indicate the place where they were
standing when they first saw the figure. When the apparition became
aware of their presence it arose, and calling them to her, said in
French, shedding tears abundantly all the time, ‘If my people will not
submit, I&nbsp;shall be obliged to let loose the arm of my son; it is so
heavy and weighty that I cannot retain it any longer. You may pray and
do what you like, you will never be able to recompense the labour I have
taken for you. I&nbsp;have given you six days for work, and have
reserved for myself the seventh, but they will not grant me it; it is
that that makes the arm of my son so heavy. Those who drive carts cannot
swear without using (inserting) the name of my son. These are the two
things which make the arm of my son so burdensome.’ She continued a
little longer in French till, observing the children did not understand
her, she added in patois a long harangue in the same strain,
a&nbsp;diatribe on the blasphemy of the age and the desecration of the
Sabbath&mdash; ‘only some old women go to mass.’ After her speech, and
having twice charged the children to make known her discourse, ‘a tout
mon peuple,’ she glided up the path between the railings, followed by
the children, to the eminence where the colossal statue stands with the
statues of the children before it, and, having ascended 5 ft., she
disappeared, looking to the S.E.” That this being was really Mary was
acknowledged by Pio IX., who sanctioned the institution of a feast-day
in her honour, and several plenary indulgences for pilgrimages and other
acts of devotion, to Notre Dame de la Salette. On the 6th August 1867
the worship (culte) of her was publicly established in Rome. The first
stone of the church, up on the mountain near the site where Mary
appeared to the children,

was laid by Bruillard, bishop of Grenoble, on 25th May 1852, assisted by
Chatrousse, bishop of Valence, in the presence of 15,000 pilgrims. In
the churches all over France and in many of those in Belgium are
pictures representing N.&nbsp;D. de la Salette addressing the children.
In the litany addressed to Mary of Salette she is appealed to as “the
tower of David,” “the gate of heaven,” “the morning star,” “the refuge
of sinners,” “the queen conceived without sin,” “the healer of
diseases,” “thou by whose supplications the arm of the irritated Lord
against us is held back,” “thou who hast said, If my people will not
submit I shall be forced to let go the arm of my son,” “thou who
continually beseechest thy divine son to have mercy upon us, pray for
us.”</p>

The lad, Pierre Maximin, after serving his time in the army, kept a shop
at Corps, upon which was written, “Objets de Piété vendus par Maximin
Giraud.” He died about the year 1880. Melanie, the girl, was sent to a
nunnery at Naples. A&nbsp;priest is said to have affirmed that the
pretended Mary was an eccentric lady called Mlle. Lamerlière, born near

Guillaume, 5550 ft. above the town. In a conspicuous situation stands
the church of Notre Dame, said to have been founded in the time of
Charlemagne. The walls, pierced with small round-headed deep-set windows
with sculptured arches resting on colonnettes, are supported by flat
buttresses rising to the eaves. The façade or west end consists of a
flat gable with a 4-storied spired tower rising from the N. side. Above
the portal is a rose window with valuable old painted glass. The N.
portal is within a portico on four columns. The two outer rest on lions;
the two inner, each a cluster of four slender columns, rest on the
shoulders of men in a sitting posture. The apse with its two apsidal
chapels and part of the adjoining wall are probably the only parts of
the church which date from the time of Charlemagne. The interior is
about 60 yds. long and 25 wide. On each side of the nave are four wide
spanned early pointed arches resting on massive rectangular piers. Above
each arch is a small roundheaded deeply-recessed window within a
corniced arch resting on colonnettes. Below in the aisles are their
exact counterparts, only about double the size. The roof of the nave is
quadripartite, and that of the aisle semicircular. The high altar and
angels are of white marble. The organ and most of the ornaments date
from the time of Louis XI., who frequently visited this church to pray
to Notre Dame d’Embrun, that white marble image of the Virgin and Child
over the altar fronting the northern entrance. On the inside of the
northern doorway (left hand) are two horseshoes, not exactly of the same
size. It is said that Lesdiguières, the Protestant leader, attempting to
ride into the church to the altar of the image of Notre Dame, the horse
reared, and the shoes of its hind hoofs sticking to the pavement, the
animal could proceed no farther.</p>

inaccessible position and the snows around for their defence. When the

out their hiding-place, he commanded a quantity of wood to be set fire

in attempting to escape, others threw themselves headlong on the rocks

is situated in the long narrow valley of the Furens, amidst productive
coal-beds. One long street, bearing the names of the Rues de Roanne,
Paris, Foy, St. Louis, and Annonay, extends from west to east, dividing
the city into two nearly equal parts. Off this street are the principal
squares or “Places.” In nearly the centre of this street, where it is
intersected by the Rue des Jardins and the Rue Royale, leading
northwards to the railway station, is the Hotel de Ville, with, at the
west end, the Post

Ecole de Dessin, reached by 53 steps, passing an artificial grotto.
Above the Ecole, in the Rue St. Barbe, reside some of the many weavers
of ribbons, who exhibit their looms with pleasure to visitors. On the
summit of this hill is a Capuchin convent and church, surmounted with a

striking is, “Nero beholding the effect of poison on slaves.” On one

other, collections of ancient tapestry, enamels, cabinets, and
furniture. In a separate saloon is the faïence, consisting chiefly of
plates. In the second storey is the <b>MUSEE DE FABRIQUE</b>. In the
centre of the room are models of the ribbon-looms, and round the walls,
under glass, specimens of the ribbons, which, from their small size and
arrangement, do not show to advantage. Even the portraits, although most
remarkable specimens of silk-weaving, are apt to be passed by, as simply
very good engravings. Among them is a group in a sitting posture
representing the Queen, Prince Albert, and the Prince of Wales, woven by
Carquillat, who has several other works of art in this room. In the

The annual value of the silk manufactures is estimated at £3,300,000,
employing 40,000 workmen and 280,000 spindles (broches), of which
165,000 work organzines and trames, and 114,000 work the silk intended
for crapes and gauze ribbons. The number of looms has been estimated in
all at 65,000 for weaving silks, and 80,000 for ribbons. The coalfields
occupy nearly 85 square miles, employ 5000 miners, and produce on an
average annually £1,600,000 worth of coal. At the west end of the long
street, opposite the gas-works, are the Manufacture d’Armes of the
Government, and adjoining their coal-pits (puits). This large
establishment is under the superintendence of artillery officers of high
rank, and employs about 2800 men. There are, besides, several private
gun manufactories throughout the town, which turn out annually as many
as 300,000 stand of arms, including pistols and revolvers. The Promenade
of St. Etienne is the Cours Fauriel. It adjoins the Jardin des Plantes,

<p>Julius Cæsar kept his military stores in Nevers; but after his defeat

cent.; and the Porte du Croux, a&nbsp;square tower of the 12th cent.,
but rebuilt in 1393, now containing an antiquarian museum. At the
entrance into the town by the Paris road is a triumphal arch, erected in
1746 to commemorate the victory of Fontenoy, 12th May 1745, when the
French defeated the Anglo-German and Dutch forces under the Duke of
Cumberland. Nevers stands on the slope of a hill rising from the Loire
in the midst of a flat country abounding with iron, giving employment to
important ironworks. In the most elevated part is the Grande Place, with
the <b>Palais de Justice</b>, formerly the Palais Ducal, a&nbsp;stately
edifice built in 1475 by Jean de Clamecy, Comte de Nevers, but altered
and enlarged during the 16th cent. by his successors, belonging to the
families of Clèves and Gonzaga. It is in the form of a parallelogram,
flanked with four towers, each containing

In the Hôtel de Ville are the Library, the Picture Gallery, and an

for eight centuries. Faïence is the French term for all descriptions of
glazed earthenware, and corresponds nearly to the English word
“crockery.” The manufacture of majolica or enamelled pottery was
introduced into France by Catherine de Médicis and her kinsman Louis
Gonzaga, who, by marriage with Henrietta of Clèves in 1565, became Duke
of Nevers. There are still important pottery works in the town.</p>

on the site of the house which used to be occupied by Madame de
Montespan and Louis XIV. About 100 yds. distant the Hôtel de France. On
a hill at the northern side of this ancient town are the ruins of the
once strong feudal castle of Bourbon, commenced by Louis&nbsp;I. in
1321, and finished in the 15th cent, by Duc Pierre&nbsp;II. Four massive
towers, built of stone, with projecting points, still remain of the
twenty-four which it had originally.
<span class = "sidetrip">
On a hill at the opposite side of the town is the parish church,
commenced in the 12th cent., resembling the church of St. Menoux. In the
centre of the town is the copious spring of mineral water which, besides
supplying the bathing establishment, is largely used for drinking and
domestic purposes. It is clear, inodorous, unctuous, easily digested,
slightly saline and aperient, and 128° Fahr. One-sixth of its volume is
free carbonic acid gas, besides the same acid in combination with lime,
magnesia, and soda; and some salts of bromine, iodine, and iron. It is
eminently diaphoretic, diuretic, and tonic, and excellent for
rheumatism, rheumatic gout, and scrofula. Between the bathing
establishment and the church is the cold water spring called the “Source
de Jonas,” containing bicarbonates of lime and magnesia, chlorides of
soda and magnesia, silicates of lime, alumina, and soda, the carbonate
of iron and the oxide of manganese. The water is tonic and slightly
laxative.

9½&nbsp;m. S. from Bourbon is <b>St. Pardoux</b>, in a wooded and hilly

carbonic acid gas. It contains the bicarbonates of lime, magnesia, and
soda, silicates of lime and alumina, and the oxide of iron. It is
delightful to the taste, very pungent, and, owing to the presence of so
much carbonic acid gas, slightly heady. It is an excellent tonic, highly
diuretic, and stimulates the secretion of bile. It is sold in litre
bottles at Bourbon at 3d. per bottle. Madame Montespan, when in the
height of her power, used regularly to visit Bourbon to recruit her
health, and here she died, in solitude, on the 25th of May 1707, cast

chloride of sodium to the pint. In lesser quantities the chlorides of
calcium and magnesium, the sulphate of soda, the carbonates of lime and
magnesia, and the oxide of iron. In Vichy the drinking of the water is
the most important, but here it is the external application by baths and
other means. They are very serviceable in the cure of nervous and
cutaneous diseases, in neuralgia of the face, and in every form of
rheumatism. The baths are of marble and easily entered, and furnished
with ingenious contrivances to facilitate the application of the water
to any particular part. Near the Casino, and standing by itself, is a
swimming bath, 62 ft. long by 29½ wide and 5 deep, filled with the

Vichy, during the season, from 15th May till the end of September, forms
a most enjoyable residence. It is full of comfortable hotels presided
over by civil landlords, charging various prices from 6½ to 25 frs. per
day, which includes wine, service, and everything else. The best
situations are the Parc and in the contiguous streets.
Tastefully-planned grounds, called the Neuf Parc, extend between the
town and the Allier, crossed here by a handsome bridge, on the site
where Caesar built his wooden bridge. On an eminence at the southern end
of Vichy are the old town and the old parish church of St. Blaise, 13th
and 14th cents. In works undertaken for the railway numerous coins have
been dug up bearing the effigy of the Gallic chief Vercingetorix, as
well as many Roman objects belonging to all the epochs of the empire. In
1402 Louis&nbsp;II., Duke of Bourbon, surrounded Vichy with a moat and
fortified walls, within which he erected his castle; but of it all that
remains is the great clock-tower or belfry.</p>

the western side the gentlemen’s baths, and on the eastern side the
ladies’. At the extremity of this passage is an inhaling-room. Each bath
costs 2½ frs., including service and linen. An hour and a quarter is
allowed, including dressing. Below the baths are large reservoirs. In
front of the entrance to the central gallery, near the spring Chomel, is
the <i>office</i> for the taking down of the bathers’ names and for the

2d, Separated by a narrow street is a similar edifice in which second
and third class baths are given, costing respectively 1½ frs. and 60 c.
each. The difference in the price of the baths arises from the quality

baths themselves are the same, and are filled too from the same springs.

But it must always be remembered that the external application of the
water is not nearly so important as the internal. Patients may visit
Vichy, at any time; but the season suited to follow with success the
course of treatment is from the 15th May till the beginning of October.
The month of May is sometimes rainy. August and September are generally
the driest months, and the most equable. The Vichy treatment lasts from
3 to 4 weeks. The waters are taken in the morning and during the day,
and baths daily or every second day. For elderly people with sanguine
and irritable temperaments and delicate constitutions the duration of
the bath should not be more than 20 or even 15 minutes.</p>

eliminated into the system, where they restore the vitality of the
organs below the diaphragm. None of the springs possess any special
specific property, the best for the patient being that which agrees best
with him. Nevertheless, experience has detected certain peculiarities
which may assist him to discover the most suitable spring. The maximum
quantity which can be taken daily with advantage is from 24 to 28 oz.
The usual dose is four glasses of 5 or 6 oz., taken at different times
throughout the day, and not necessarily from the same spring. The water
may with advantage be mixed with the wine taken at dinner. Carafes are
filled at the springs without any charge. In the shops are sold

or cirrhosis, and in hæmorrhoidal affections, which are so often
connected with congestion of the liver. They are equally serviceable in
enlargements of the spleen and in many cases of hypochondriasis.
Moreover, this spa is specially adapted for the cure of some of the
chronic diseases of women connected with disordered menstruation, and
for the anomalous “critical complaints” which often set in at the period
of life when this function ceases. “The complaint for which nine-tenths
of the English visitors drink these springs is gout; but it should be
distinctly understood that Vichy water is not a specific for gout; it
can only act on the gouty diathesis by improving the tone of the
digestive organs, augmenting the secretions, and correcting the
abnormally acid condition of the blood.” &mdash;<i>Madden’s Health
Resorts.</i> “The Vichy waters do not cure gout. They have, however,
a&nbsp;very beneficial effect when administered with caution in cases of
either hereditary or acquired gout, whether articular or internal, acute
or chronic. The proper time to use the waters is in the interval of
attacks, and as far as possible from the last attack. If too near the
last attack, a&nbsp;repetition is to be feared, and there is almost as
much danger in provoking nature as in resisting its action in a crisis.”
&mdash;<i>Dr. Daumas.</i> “We may then sum up the effects of a Vichy
course, when judiciously prescribed, as restorative to the digestive and
assimilative functions, and invigorative to the general health. The tone
of the stomach is soon improved, digestion becomes easier and more
rapid, pain and weight after food disappearing. The bile flows more
freely. The bowels become regular. Diarrhœa, if previously present,
ceases. The consequence of these changes is better assimilation, and
therefore flesh is often gained. With the improvement in nutrition the
colour returns to the cheeks and energy to the mind.” &mdash;<i>Dr.
P.&nbsp;James.</i></p>

Roanne, cost from 75 c. to 1&nbsp;fr. the mètre. At Grivats they are all

From this spring the road follows at a little distance the course of the
stream Sermon, passing the villages of Les Séchauds and the Bois
Randenez, and then enters the forest of Boucharde, at the southern
extremity of which is situated Randan, with its large modern mansion
belonging to the Orleans family. It contains a picture gallery with
several drawings by the gifted Marie d’Orleans, the rooms of Madame
Adelaide and of her brother Louis Philippe, a&nbsp;beautiful little
chapel, and a large kitchen (see <a href = "#page368">p.&nbsp;368</a>).
From Randan the road leads due E. through the woods to the hunting-seat
of Maulmont, constructed by Madame Adelaide in the Gothic style, on the

Thiers, with its old houses, and steep, tortuous, dirty streets, is
built on the side of Mt. Besset, which rises to the height of 1716 ft.
above the sea, but only 405 ft. above the old prison near the “Place.”
At the foot of this mountain flows the impetuous Durolle, which turns
the wheels of the paper-mills and forges in the low town. From the
different terraces are splendid views of the curiously-shaped
surrounding mountains and of the plains of the Limagne. The manufacture
of cutlery (coutellerie) is the standard occupation of the inhabitants.
The steel is made in the forges; all the rest is done in the houses of
the workmen, each individual of the family taking the part in the
manufacture corresponding to his or her ability. At the foot of Mt.
Besset, near the Durolle, is the church of St. Moutiers, of the 11th
cent., excepting the square apse, which is of the 7th. From the chancel
a very pretty road leads up the valley of the Durolle to the Margeride.
The church in the high part of the town to the left is St. Jean, 14th
cent., with a cemetery. Considerably higher than St. Jean is St. Genest,
built in about 1020. It has been recently restored. Over the second
altar, left or north of the high altar, is a fresco, 16th cent.,
representing Mary among angels entering heaven. The painted glass is
modern. 3&nbsp;m. S.E. from Thiers is the village of Escoutoux, where a
pleasant sparkling wine is made called Champagne de la Dore. Excellent
butter and cheese are made at Thiers. The richest are flat and thin, but
the most pungent is a cheese not unlike the Stilton in shape and colour.

founded in the 9th and rebuilt in the 14th cent. The material is basalt
and Volvic lava, which admits of a very sharp edge. The narrow round
belfry on the N. side is 165 ft. high. Round the nave and choir are
twenty-eight, or, including those of the transepts, thirty-six fascicled
piers, which rise nearly to the roof. Between are pointed arches, and
immediately above, the triforium, having over each arch a treble window
resting on four fascicled and three impost colonnettes. As the choir
contracts towards the apsidal termination the piers become less massive
and the arches ⅓ narrower. The stained glass of the clerestory windows
of the nave dates from the 15th cent.; but only a few are complete,
having been injured by a hailstorm in 1835. The best glass is in the
apse and in the N. transept, dating from the 13th cent. The glass in the
rose of the S. transept, which is also beautiful, is modern. The clock,
with its three men to strike the hours and quarters, dates from the 16th
cent. Ten chapels radiate from the choir. In the first on the N. side is
a miracle-working image of Mary and Child.</p>

<p>The house in which Blaise Pascal was born in 1623 is No. 2 Passage

friezes, while the apse and its radiating chapels have besides patterns

tower.</p>

<p>In the interior the roof is waggon-vaulted with no groining. Round
the nave are fourteen piers with attached columns, having on their
capitals sculptured figures of men, animals, and plants. The chancel is

less stilted according to the width of the space. The triforium is
massive and on short columns. All the glass is modern, excepting in the
window behind the high altar and in each of the windows in the S. and N.
ends of the chancel, which date from the beginning of the 13th cent.</p>

<p>Below the chancel is the crypt, supported on twelve massive columns.
Over the altar is a miracle-working image, about 6 inches high, of Mary
and child Jesus, found at the bottom of the well, 18 ft. deep, in 578,
when the foundations of the first church were being laid. The well,
which is covered, is in front of the altar. Its water is endowed with
miraculous properties. The walls are lined with expressions of gratitude
for favours obtained by praying to this tiny representative of the woman
Mary.</p>

<p>It was within the walls of the upper church, when Pope Urban&nbsp;II.
and Peter the Hermit were exhorting their hearers in 1096 to undertake
the first crusade, that the whole assembly, as if impelled by an
immediate inspiration, exclaimed with one voice, “It is the will of

grayish-white, fine grained, compact, earthy, often friable, and with
flakes of brown mica. It appears to be a decomposed trachyte, in which
the feldspar has been affected, but not the mica. The most perfect
craters here are the Puy-de-Pariou, 3970 ft. high, and the Nid de la

Junction here with the line to Capdenac, 110&nbsp;m. S.W., traversing
the whole of the interesting geological region of the Cantal. (See
Black’s <i>South France</i>, West Half.)</p>

<p>From the hamlet of Neussargues, 30½ m. S.W. from Arvant, commences
the loop-line of the Chemins de Fer du Midi, which traverses the lofty
woodless highlands of Lozère, the coal-region of Aveyron, and the wine
and olive department of Herault to Beziers on the Mediterranean line,
between Cette and Narbonne. On this line, 11¾&nbsp;m. S. from
Neussargues, 7&nbsp;m. S. from St. Flour, and 37½&nbsp;m. N. from
Marvejols, is the highest bridge in the world, the Pont de Garabit,
which crosses the ravine of the Truyère 400 ft. above the river. The
span of the great arch is 541½ ft., and the length of the viaduct

<a name = "brioude" id = "brioude"><b>BRIOUDE</b></a>, 1430 ft. above
the sea, pop. 5000. <i>Inns:</i> *Nord; Commerce. A&nbsp;dirty town on a
tableland, 1¼&nbsp;m. from the Allier. The parish church St. Julien
(restored) dates from the 11th and 12th cents. The W. façade, of red
sandstone, is flat, with round-headed windows over the three portals.
The largest, the centre one, is between two thick plain buttresses, over
which rises a low square tower. On the S. side of the church is another
portal, preceded by a massive portico on three large semicircular
arches, resting on short square piers with attached columns bearing
large foliaged capitals. On the N. side is a similar entrance, but
plainer. From the choir rises a square tower, becoming octagonal in the
two upper stages. From the apse, which is semicircular, radiate at a
lower level five semicircular chapels, their roofs terminating in a
cornice of tiny stone interlaced arches. The wall of the apse above the
chapels is ornamented with a mosaic, chiefly stars, in black and white
stones.</p>

<p>The interior of the church is surrounded by great, tall, square piers
with attached columns and vaulting shafts bearing grotesque foliaged
capitals. Over the arches, which are early pointed, run a built-up
triforium and circular clerestory windows. The five chapels have a
profusion of colonnettes, three round-headed windows each, and some
beautiful sculpture in relief. Under the chancel is a crypt.</p>

<p>Behind the church is the covered market, and a little farther the
Hôtel de Ville, with the town promenade on a terrace overlooking the
plain.</p>

the highly-cultivated vineclad mountains rising from Clermont. The first
station is Royat, with the hotels Univers; Monnet; Nice; St. Mart,
adjoining the Casino; Grand Hotel; Continental Hotel. On the road up to
Royat are H.&nbsp;Chabassière; Victoria; Paix; Paris; Europe; Lyons.
Higher up beyond the hotels is the village of Royat. The parish church,
founded in the 7th cent, and rebuilt in the 10th and 11th, was
heightened and fortified in the 12th cent. In the centre of the transept
is a low tower, square in the first stage and octagonal in the second.
Under the small chancel, raised 5 ft. above the floor of the nave, is a
crypt supported on six colonnettes.</p>

<p>In the “Place” is a crucifix of lava erected in 1486. At the back of
J.&nbsp;C. is Mary with the child, and the apostles standing on
consoles. The narrow steep road from in front of the Mary side leads

The road, after crossing the Tirtaine, enters the territory of St. Mart.
In the lower part of the valley, in a small park on the right side of
the Tirtaine, is the bathing establishment, supplied by five springs, of
which the most important is the Eugenie, which rises in front of the
establishment; temperature, 100° Fahr. The principal ingredients are the
chlorate of sodium, mixed with the bicarbonates of lime, soda, and
magnesia, and a little iron. The baths are made of volcanic tufa. The
charge is from 1½ fr. to 2½ frs. according to the season.</p>

<p>Besides the hotels already mentioned there are around the
establishment the H.&nbsp;St. Mart; the H.&nbsp;Splendide; Bains;
Bristol, all large first-class houses. On the road up the left bank of
the Tirtaine are the Louvre; Richelieu; Belle Vue; France et Angleterre;

is situated among high mountains, in the narrow valley of the Dordogne,
3402 ft. above the sea. <i>Hotels.</i>&mdash;Considering the style of
their furniture and of the meals, they are rather dear. The charge in
the first-class houses is from 12 to 18 frs. per day, which includes
coffee or tea in the morning, two meals with wine and service. The
difference in the price is caused by the position of the room. Around
the “Place” of the bathing establishment are the first-class houses,
Chabaury ainé; Paris; Poste. By the side of the Casino, the H.&nbsp;du
Parc and the Grand Hotel, which last charges from 16 to 21 frs. as it is
rather better furnished. Around these hotels are what may be considered
second-class houses, but if no agreement is made they are apt to charge
as much as those of the first class: H.&nbsp;Bardet-Chanonat;
H.&nbsp;Boyer-Bertrand; the Paix, open all the year; H.&nbsp;Ramade;
H.&nbsp;Parisien; France; Nord; Madeuf-Baraduc; Thermes. The Casino is a
handsome edifice, the greatest part being occupied by the theatre and
the halls connected with it. The Mineral Bath Establishment and the
Inhaling Establishment occupy two sides of the principal square; the
other two are occupied by the first-class hotels.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The bathing establishment is slightly lugubrious; otherwise it is well
adapted for the cure or alleviation of the diseases it professes to
treat. The springs for drinking are arranged in the vestibule just
within the entrance. In the right-hand corner is the Source de la
Madeleine or Bertrand, temperature 113° Fahr. Besides containing the
usual quantity of the arseniate of soda, about one-thousandth part in
two pints, it contains more than any of the other springs of the
bicarbonate of soda, lime, and magnesia. Next it is the Source Ramond,
temperature 107°, containing the greatest quantity of iron. It rises in
an octagonal basin built of large stones by the Romans. Then the Source
César, temperature 113°, used chiefly for baths. Towards the left-hand
end is the Source Sainte Marguerite, temperature 55°, used at table
mixed with the wine.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
Among the baths there are five upstairs supplied directly from some
little springs which rise through the fissures of the rock. The flow in
and out is constant. These baths are made of stone; all the others are
of iron. Besides the usual appliances for making the water act upon the
more delicate parts of the body, there are also elaborate arrangements
for foot-bathing and for douching the nose.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
The tariffs of everything at Bourboule and Mont-Dore depend on the
month. The hotels, baths, casinos, etc., are at their dearest during
July, the height of the season. An ordinary bath with towels costs then
2&nbsp;frs., at other times 1½ fr.; a&nbsp;nose douche, 50 c. to 75 c.
Baths from 92° to 100° should be continued from 30 to 40 minutes; from
109° to 112°, from 10 to 15 minutes. The charge for drinking the water
in July is 10 frs., in other months 5&nbsp;frs. The men who carry the
sedan-chairs between the hotels and the establishment are paid by
tickets bought at the office of the baths.</p>

Bourboule contains, besides what is given here, the chloride of
potassium and magnesium. The active and special principle of both waters
is the arseniate of soda, which, it will be observed, is 29 times more
abundant in the Bourboule water than in that of Mont-Dore. The
temperature of the two hottest Bourboule springs is 140° F., or 27°
above the hottest of Mont-Dore.</p>

These waters are recommended for certain forms of chronic bronchitis,
asthma, and laryngeal complaints, gastro-enteric and uterine disorders
marked by congestion, similar cases in which the liver is implicated,
nervous maladies, and scrofulous diseases.&mdash;Madden’s <i>Health
Resorts</i>. Three or four glasses of the Madeleine water are taken
daily by the majority of patients. It produces an increase of appetite,
and is often attended with diarrhœa about the fifth or sixth day; this
is mostly succeeded by a certain degree of constipation, which
frequently lasts to the end of the course. About the twentieth day a
disgust of the water is generally experienced, which is an indication
that the saturation point has been obtained.&mdash;Lee’s

The Springs.</a></h5>

<p class = "sidetrip">
Bourboule possesses seven mineral springs, of which five are on the
right bank of the Dordogne, and two, the Sources Fenestre on the left,
in the Park. The three most important, the Perrière, the Choussy, and
Sédaiges, are within a few feet of each other, near the Mabru bathhouse.
They rise from the place where the trachytic rocks overlap the granite,
and were obtained by boring to the depth of from 82 to 92 ft. The water
pumped up by steam-engines has, above ground, a&nbsp;temperature of 140°
F.</p>

<p class = "sidetrip">
These three springs produce the strongest arsenical water as yet
discovered. Near them, but still on the same side of the river, are the
springs of the Puits de la Plage, 81°, and of the Puits Central, 104°,
mineralised more feebly, but in the same proportions. The two springs
Fenestre, on the opposite side of the river, are cold (64° F.), and as
they contain more free carbonic acid gas than the others, are drunk with
wine at dinner.</p>

<h5 class = "itinerary"><a name = "bourboule_springs_effects" id =
"bourboule_springs_effects">
Their Constituents and Effects.</a></h5>

<p class = "sidetrip">
Of the springs, Perrière, Choussy, and Sédaiges, each litre (11/50 of a
gallon) contains 82 grains of mineral substances, of which nearly one
half is the bicarbonate of soda, and the other half the chloride of
sodium; and every 28 ounces contains the third of a grain of the
arseniate of soda (see <a href = "#mont_dore_water">p.&nbsp;379</a>).
Besides the special uses of these waters arising from the arsenic, their
composition, resembling that of the serum of the blood, makes them
applicable to cases of arrested development, defective nutrition, cases
of slow convalescence, and other forms of general debility. In all
scrofulous affections, such as enlarged glands, scrofulous discharges
from mucous membranes, diseases of the bones, etc., these waters produce
great benefit. But it is more especially in the chronic forms of skin
disease that La Bourboule claims to effect the most remarkable cures,
and chiefly when they arise in connection with a rheumatic or scrofulous
constitution, or as the result of simple debility. The scrofulous form
of pulmonary consumption, nasal and pharyngeal catarrhs, asthma, and
chronic bronchitis, are all alleviated by the use of the Bourboule
waters.</p>

The parish church, built on a rock, 11th cent., is a curious specimen of
Auvergnian architecture. In the neighbourhood, at Pernay, is a dolmen,
of which the horizontal surface is 13 ft. by 6½ ft.; and 2½ m. distant
the cascade of the Granges. 8¾&nbsp;m. beyond, towards Issoire, is
Champeix, pop. 2100, most picturesquely situated in the valley of the
Couze. From Champeix the plateau of Pardines, 1620 ft., may be ascended;
whence continue to the Tour de Maurifolet, and descend by the stair in
the cliff to Perrier, pop. 600, among rocks pierced with caves,
3&nbsp;m. from <a href = "#issoire">Issoire</a> (p.&nbsp;372).</p>
